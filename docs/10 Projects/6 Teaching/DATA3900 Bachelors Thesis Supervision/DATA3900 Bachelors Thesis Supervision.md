Together with MTC, we have discussed and planned a solution for contact centres. They have done something similar at Microsoft in Sweden, and a team has now been assembled here in Norway to be able to do something similar. The client also wants to implement AI into the solution, in the form of chat bots. In the assignment, we will use Microsoft products, such as Visual Studio, Dynamics 365 and Power Apps.

## Briefly about DATA3900
DATA3900 Bachelor's thesis is a compulsory subject for third-year students in the three fields of study
at the department of IT, OsloMet.
the task is.
‚Ä¢ Applied computer technology
‚Ä¢ Engineering - data ‚Ä¢ Information
technology
DATA3900 Bachelor thesis is a 20-credit course that most third-year students complete in the 6th
semester. The bachelor thesis is completed in groups of 2-5 students. The projects that the bachelor groups find themselves are approved by the department of IT (head of department) and each project is assigned an internal supervisor. 

It is normal for each of the relevant internal supervisors to be responsible for 3-4 projects. The supervisor's
task is to follow up the project group and ensure that the group makes progress. This will normally happen by holding weekly meetings between the supervisor and the project group. 

The project period runs from the beginning of January until submission in May and the oral exam is approx. two weeks after submission. In the 6th semester, a writing course is held for the students in report writing and the University Library holds an introduction to literature search, source criticism, reference management and plagiarism.

## Project documentation
The submission deadline for the bachelor's projects is at the end of May, the exact deadline is set by
the study administration. By the deadline, the students must have submitted the project report in its entirety in
|rything that is to be assessed as part of the bachelor's thesis must be submitted in Inspera.

## Documentation
The project report will often consist of the following parts: 
a) the task's background and objectives,
b) process documentation and 
c) product documentation. In many cases, there will also be user documentation and test reports.

The assignment's background and objectives must describe the assignment's background and objectives, here readers get an introduction to the assignment's context. In the background and aim of the assignment, it must be clearly stated what the aim is

The process documentation must describe the process that led to the final result. Here the reader will get an
introduction to how the work has been, what choices the students have made, what development method they
have used, what challenges they have had, how any problems have been solved, what they have learned etc.
Documentation


The product documentation must provide an academic-technical description of the project's results. Depending on the aim of the bachelor's thesis, in the product description the students must describe the product that has been developed/tested, possibly the research question that has been attempted to be answered. Which solution does the bachelor's group propose to achieve the goal as described in the requirements specification? A reader, e.g. the examiner, who must read all the documentation continuously, may experience a number of repetitions. But that's how it has to be.

In those projects where there is a lot of programming, large amounts of source code will often be included in the product documentation. We have said that the source code must then be made available via Inspera. In some cases, the client has placed restrictions on what can be made public. The requirement is that everything that is to be included in the assessment of a project must be available to both the examiner and supervisor in Inspera.

If the examiner discovers that there are things that are missing, do not work or have other problems with the project, we ask that the examiner contact the project's internal supervisor. Who it is will appear from the documentation, and can also be found on the project overview.

## The presentations

The project groups/students must provide an audiovisual presentation of and/or demonstration of the functions in their projects. This takes place in the period 07.06 - 15.06.2022 (tentatively) and each project is allocated approx. 30 minutes.

Each group prepares a presentation of approx. 20 minutes, then approx. 5 minutes for questions from the examiner and possibly others if time permits. A timetable will be set up for this. Most of the projects that are presented on the same day have the same examiner, and it is part of the agreement between the department and the examiner that he/she is present at the presentations.

Implementation
We ask that the examiner has completed a grade proposal for each project before the discussions at the examiner's meeting start. The grading scale for bachelor's projects has traditionally been somewhat different from that for ordinary exams. It has been somewhat reduced and shifted to the left (A). Follow table shows the car species distribution in recent years:
The last minutes of each presentation are set aside for questions, and we ask the examiner to prepare questions for each project. An examiner meeting is held each day - after the last presentation for the day has finished.


## Eval Criteria
See the form below. The final grade will be a weighted average of the grades assigned to the various parts.

| Assesment of         | Subpoints                                                               | percentage |

## The sensor meeting
Those who will be present are the examiner and the supervisors for the projects that have been presented, but it is
desirable that as many of the other supervisors as possible also participate. Formally, the grade on a project is determined
jointly by an external examiner and the project's supervisor. At the examiners' meeting, however, all the projects are
discussed in plenary and the aim is to arrive at a common consensus for the grading of all the projects.
