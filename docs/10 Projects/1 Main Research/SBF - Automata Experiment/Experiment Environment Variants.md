Spawned from :: [[SBF - Automata Experiment]]

Statement:: Add proposed experimental conditions for the expanded version of the experiment

# SBFA Experimental conditions
## Current conditions
Right now the experiment uses a *single action*, *single RP* conditions.

We would like to expand this to some simple variations, and then eventually to some animal tasks (see [[@petterIntegratingModelsInterval2018]]).

We would also like to expand the model. Perhaps make a new article on that. 

## Proposed Simple variations
Current: Single action, single RP,
Variation 2: multiple RP (Simultaneous RPs)
Variation 3: changing RP (halfway through RP changes)

Multiple Action
