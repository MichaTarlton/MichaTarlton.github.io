Excited to share our new preprint on how network dynamics and structured connectivity jointly define the spatial and temporal profiles of neural correlations. Work w/ [@roxana_zeraati](https://twitter.com/roxana_zeraati), [@SelfOrgAnna](https://twitter.com/SelfOrgAnna), [@EngelTatiana](https://twitter.com/EngelTatiana): [arxiv.org/abs/2207.07930](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07930)   Here is a [#tweeprint](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tweeprint) : [pic.twitter.com/f7BjGMJRlx](https://twitter.com/YanliangShi/status/1549533278192943111/photo/1)

1/8 Correlated fluctuations in the activity of neural populations occur across multiple temporal and spatial scales, which relate to computations in many cognitive tasks.

2/8 While temporal and spatial correlations are usually studied separately, they emerge from the same spatiotemporal dynamics. So how are they related to each other?

3/8 To answer this question, we derived analytical expressions for spatiotemporal correlations in networks of binary units with connectivity arranged in one and two dimensions. [pic.twitter.com/lrEsYrU8dX](https://twitter.com/YanliangShi/status/1549533286350864384/photo/1)

4/8 We showed that multiple timescales in auto- and cross-correlations arise from interactions among network units defined by spatial connectivity.

5/8 Specifically, the autocorrelation contains an intrinsic timescale and a set of interaction timescales generated by spatial interactions among units. The interaction timescales are shared between auto- and cross-correlations. [pic.twitter.com/8z2Q9BGRKa](https://twitter.com/YanliangShi/status/1549533292512280577/photo/1)

6/8 Using Fourier transformation, we showed that each interaction timescale arises from fluctuations at a different spatial frequency mode, contributing hierarchically to the overall patterns of correlations.

7/8 Both spatial and temporal scales of correlations depend on the spatial connectivity range because interaction timescales decrease heterogeneously with broader spatial connectivity. [pic.twitter.com/st0LGWm1Q3](https://twitter.com/YanliangShi/status/1549533302960406528/photo/1)

8/8 Finally, external inputs can modulate the correlation timescales when spatial interactions are nonlinear, and the modulation effect depends on the operating regime of network dynamics.
