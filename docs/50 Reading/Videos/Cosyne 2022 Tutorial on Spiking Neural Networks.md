Originally put my notes on this in [[Topics of immediate interest to me in my project 04.04.22]], which covers only a little more but isn’t just about this talk

[Cosyne 2022 Tutorial on Spiking Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL09WqqDbQWHGJd7Il3yVxiBts5nRSxvJ4)

See also Goodmans’s website on this tutorial [Cosyne Tutorial 2022 - Spiking Neural Networks | Spiking Neural Network Models in Neuroscience](https://neural-reckoning.github.io/cosyne-tutorial-2022/)

Sparked interest in [[Payeur et al. 2021]] which I still haven’t entirely dedicated to memory though I think it proposes a cool model of back propagation.

See [[50 Reading/citations/@zenkeVisualizingJointFuture2021]]
