# Free writing exercises

Fill 5 minutes with text.

What are my goals and aims this week
- To make writing an easier affair
- To make writing more collaborative and design a smooth method of knowledge transfer and addition between team members
- To increase my own production output or creative method
- You have worked pretty hard on your technical methods so most edges should be sanded off
- and now you should just need to write and then the information should easily flow to the locations it is needed
- although still room for improvement 

Thinking about what else I should do
- the smooth manifold of knowledge should be easily accessible from any point
- That is any information I put in one place should immediately be aaccessible elsewhere when deemed related 
- So why I tag things, is so that they will appear elsewhere
- Need more query design tbh
- I think I should alos go through and reorganize my DB of files
- including the old stuff from my master’s project
- I just need one more PC or hardware I say
	- It doesn’t help that HW is constantly  failing me to begin with
- This also appears very slow for whatever reason, maybe I need to increase refresh rate on my PC
	- Why does it appear smoother on Mac
-
