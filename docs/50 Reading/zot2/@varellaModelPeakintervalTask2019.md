> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> Specific mechanisms underlying how the brain keeps track of time are largely unknown. Several existing computational models of timing reproduce behavioral results obtained with experimental psychophysical tasks, but only a few tackle the underlying biological mechanisms, such as the synchronized neural activity that occurs throughout brain areas. In this paper, we introduce a model for the peak-interval task based on neuronal network properties. We consider that Local Field Potential (LFP) oscillation cycles specify a sequence of states, represented as neuronal ensembles. Repeated presentation of time intervals during training reinforces the connections of specific ensembles to downstream networks — sets of neurons connected to the sequence of states. Later, during the peak-interval procedure, these downstream networks are reactivated by previously experienced neuronal ensembles, triggering behavioral responses at the learned time intervals. The model reproduces experimental response patterns from individual rats in the peak-interval procedure, satisfying relevant properties such as the Weber law. Finally, we provide a biological interpretation of the parameters of the model.

## Scalar Expectancy Theory, SET (Gibbon, 1977; Grondin, 2014). 
- SET is a cognitive process model which assumes the existence of a pacemaker which emits pulses at a certain rate that are stored by an accumulator. The temporal estimation comes from counting the number of pulses in the accumulator and comparing it to a number of pulses previously stored in the reference memory (i.e., past experiences).

> "*How the brain represents the passage of time and uses this information in time-related tasks is still an ongoing debate in the scientific community. There seems to be different mechanisms involved in temporal processing depending on the time scale [(p. 1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RB8NKQBE?page=1&annotation=AEJ45BKP) *"
