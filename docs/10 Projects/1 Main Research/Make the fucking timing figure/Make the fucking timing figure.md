# Directions from Gustavo
- [ ] For the sake of precision, remember that press and reward never happen at the exact same time

- [ ] in the first figure, it is not very clear what time is. maybe the lable should move to a different place or put an arrow somwhere.

- [ ] make a nice figure (using matplotlib and python) of the second figure you drafted

- [ ] write a nice caption. for both of the figures and put as place holders in your survey.

- Next week is to try to play with OpenAI gym, make the same figure for the bissection task, and look at models that explain fixed intervals
 
- It would be nice if you can work on a description of the task as well.

- remember 1 paragraph = 1 idea. Paragraphs start with a topic sentence, often a statement or an assertion about the world that will be explainded, detailed or argued for in the paragraph. Follow it with explanations, descriptions, examples and analogies. Examples and analogies are very important!! try to think other behaviors or situations where fixed interval could apply and why it is important. remember to link the paragraph to the figure.

- prioritize this, because all the information is fresh in your mind, before you move to the next one.

# Figure Descriptions
## Fixed Interval (FI)
In fixed interval tasks, an animal must respond to a stimulus after a learned interval of time. In this case the trial is initiated with a discriminative stimulus. The first lever press response from the animal, in response to the initiating stimulus, begins the fixed interval time.

 After the FI time from the initial press, another reward is available. The first lever press from the animal following the FI is rewarded with a reinforcement stimulus.
 
The point of this is to study the animal motor or neural behavior during the task, from which we can interpret how the animal internally represents the passage of time.

To make comparative experiments, we repeat the experiment in repeated sequences in what is the *serial fixed interval task* (shown below) as well as for different duration sizes of the fixed interval. 

## Serial Fixed Interval  
At the end of each FI trial an exponentially distributed inter-trial interval is added. This reduces the predictability of the next trial.

The FI delay can be static or incremenatally increased in duration over the trials. This allows for measurement of behavior in changing conditions to trained expectations.

## Peak Interval (PI)
Peak interval testing is similar to serial fixed interval trials, however several trials, randomly chosen,  do not deliver the reinforcement reward when the animal responds. These are called *peak trials*. The goal being to observe when the onset and tapering of the animalâ€™s expectation of reward. These are longer than the typical FI trial, with a minimum duration of 3 * FI.
