> [!Excerpt] Abstract
> Neuronal oscillations offer access to neuronal operations, bringing microscopic and macroscopic mechanisms, experimental methods, and explanations to a common platform. The field of brain rhythms has become the agora of discussions from temporal coordination of neuronal populations within and across brain regions to cognitive phenomena, including language and brain diseases.
