Ok it looks like I want to base my survey on timing based tasks in SNNs as of recent.

We need to be on look out for “problems” as well as “solutions”
Or perhaps tasks and methods used with them.
Either way I refer to both as individual “topics”
Perhaps, container-ize them in two suprasections
Ø.General Problem
A. Problems
B. Methods

# 1. Literature Review(s)
- Starting with a few points of reference regarding the various scopes I am pursuing.
	- In the case of each “scope” start with a relevant paper or review that stands out
- Find subsequently published papers referring to the relevant paper, its citations, and similar papers.
	- Find additional related papers to the subsequent papers based on abstracts and meatinfo
- Bin said papers into related collections, broadly staying within planned scopes
- Review paper contents, tag and extract methods and topics I find relevant into collated notes
- Redefine scope based on extracted topics
	- Possibly branch other scopes 


E.g. Starting with [[@patonNeuralBasisTiming2018]]
→ Identify topics that may be relevant to initial scope
→ See subsequent papers that have cited it
→ Collect and review the few that directly cite it and also fall within my initial scope
- zhouEncodingTimeNeural2022
- hardyEncodingTimeFeedforward2018
- tallotNeuralEncodingTime2020
→ Collect additional papers that are indirectly related to the original  and bin them based on relevance to a particular relationship to the scope
- Papers that are related to topics in my initial scope
→ Review papers for:
- relevant content
- topics that I think maybe relevant to my scope
→ Collect relevant topics and build on them with information from multiple papers collected
- Note how they relate to other topics in scope

# 2.  Drafting
- Review highlighted citations from collated topics
- Search for additional relevant materials based on collated topics and revised scope
- Integrate any additional topics if within purview of revised scope
- Outline overview of topics
- Draft key take-aways and comparisons between related topics

# 3. Writing
- Begin writing and coalescing subjects
- Ideally, citations will have followed from the topic notes
