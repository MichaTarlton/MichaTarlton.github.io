## Time Cells
Encoding time receptive fields across a time axis

I like this because it shows how there are multiple cells here and they have a curve here. So this is probably what’s meant by time cell in that they activate in this order repeatedly?

## Time Encoding Methods

> there's not just time cells the time cells are derived from this other population of cells let's call them uh **temporal context cells** and rather than having receptive fields that tile the time axis with different cells having different peaks along different parts of the axis, we proposed that these cells ought to code for the same type of information with exponential receptive fields and that rather than having different time points rather than peaking at different points that the variability across cells should be carried by the rate at which they decay

This does not convey useful information if you zoom in or out on the x axis.
What it does do is give you information on it’s time constant, how far it is away from it’s input.
Combine with multiple cells and you can determine timing of input based on the time constants of the different cells.
