# The Model
## [[@matellNeuropsychologicalMechanismsInterval2000|Matell & Meck (2000)]]
The original paper which proposed this[[Striatal Beat Frequency Model]]




## STRIATUM Model / SBF model
From [[@tallotNeuralEncodingTime2020]]

> *“The main group of internal clock models are pacemaker accumulator models (PA). Taking into account the intrinsic functioning of neurons and known network connectivity, Matell and Meck (2000) proposed the **[[Topics - Striatal Beat Frequency model (SBF)]]**. It involves numerous cortical oscillators (representing the pacemaker and accumulator), and the detection of their coincident activation by the medium spiny neurons of the striatum on which they project.”* [(p. 157)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=12&annotation=KZIW4R4U)

> *“pacemaker accumulator models (PA)”* [(p. 157)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=12&annotation=VPG4URJM)

> *“At the start of a stimulus, the oscillators are synchronized (maybe by a dopamine burst, Kononowicz, 2015) while keeping their own distinct frequencies, meaning that they will not remain synchronized over time. When a significant event happens (e.g., at the end of the stimulus or at the appearance of a reinforcement), the state of these different oscillators is encoded and stored by the striatum.”* [(p. 157)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=12&annotation=DYAFAWWG)-  

**❤kfuck,thisisgood.Butwhatis"StoredbySTR''mean?**

> *“By comparing the oscillators’ ongoing activity to the memorized patterns, it is possible for the striatum to determine how much time has passed, provided that the oscillatory activity remains very stable across time”* [(p. 157)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=12&annotation=NFF246WG)
