# Notes
- Some important specification on how to implement an excitatory inhibitory model in [[@guOscillatoryMultiplexingNeural2015a]]
- Or at least they specify so in the paper
 > At the neural-network level, a coupled excitatory/inhibitory oscillation (EIO) feature was added to the SBF model to show how interval timing and working memory can originate from the same oscillatory processes but differ in terms of which dimension of the neural oscillation is utilized for item extraction, temporal order, and duration information.
