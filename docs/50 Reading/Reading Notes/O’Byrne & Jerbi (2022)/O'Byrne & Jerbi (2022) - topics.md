# Topics 
## Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC)
[Increased spontaneous MEG signal diversity for psychoactive doses of ketamine, LSD and psilocybin | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421)

> The Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ) is a popular tool to quantify the uncertainty contained in time series data. In particular, LZ measures how “diverse” are the patterns that are present in a particular signal.

> LZ is calculated in two steps. First, the value of a given signal of length is binarised. The standard way of doing this is calculating its mean value and turning each data point above it to `1`s and each point below it to `0`s; however, other possibilities have also been used (thresholding over the median, using the Hilbert transform, etc…). As a second step, the resulting binary sequence is scanned sequentially looking for distinct structures or _patterns_, building up a dictionary that summarises the sequences seen so far. Finally, the LZ index is determined by the length of this dictionary; i.e., is the number of distinct patterns found, denoted by . Note that regular signals can be characterized by a small number of patterns and hence have low LZ complexity, while irregular signals require long dictionaries and hence have a high LZ complexity.

Lol so wait this is essentially a measure of distributions on a binary string? So you can just take an entropy measure? Right? Like isn’t this just info entropy?

How does this relate to Minimum Description Length?

## Avalanche criticality

a large class of continuous phase transitions that separate a phase where activity dissipates from a phase where activity is amplified; they are characterized by scale-free avalanches.

## Chaos

the property of a process whose trajectory in phase space is sensitive to small differences in initial conditions.

## Control parameter
A variable that, when tuned past a critical value, brings about a phase transition in a system, (e.g., temperature in the water–steam transition).


## Dynamic range

the range of input rates that are separately encodable within the system dynamics.

## Dynamical system

a physical model or mathematical system that evolves in time according to fixed equations, but which often gives rise to complex behavior.

## Edge of chaos

a phase transition between a stable phase and a chaotic phase.

## Emergence

said of a high-level property that cannot readily be explained in terms of its low-level constituents. This intractability can be variously interpreted. In weak emergence interpretations, the inexplicability is merely a practical one due to the sheer complexity of the computation required to reach an explanation and reductionism still holds in principle. In strong emergence interpretations, the emergent property possesses causal autonomy independently of its constituents, thus challenging the principle of reductionism.

## Mutual information

an information-theoretic measure of the amount of information shared between two sources.

## Neuronal avalanche

a cascade of neural events (e.g., action potentials) that starts from a single seed event and propagates through a population.

## Phase transition

a boundary (hyperplane) in phase space at which a macroscopic property of the system (the order parameter) qualitatively changes (e.g. the water–steam transition, the magnetization of iron, or the onset of chaos in artificial neural networks).

### First-Order or Discontinuous 
the critical point is too unstable; these are first-order or discontinuous phase transitions, with freezing and boiling water falling into this category

### Second-Order or Continuous
Criticality is maintainable only in second-order or continuous phase transitions, and even then, it requires precise tuning of a control parameter.
## Power law

a mathematical relationship *f* (*x*) *~ x*<sup>β</sup> where one quantity *f* (*x*) varies proportionally to another quantity *x* raised to a certain power *β*. Also known as a scaling law.

## Scale-free or scale-invariant

said of a shape or process whose statistics remain the same under a change of scale (i.e., spatial, temporal, or energy scale).

## Self-organized criticality (SOC)

any type of criticality that is autonomously maintained through homeostatic-like feedback loops.

## Spin glass

a magnet-like model where the couplings between nodes can be positive or negative (instead of only positive), resulting in so-called frustrated interactions, chaos, and metastable states.

## Stability

the property of a system that returns to its initial state within a finite period after a perturbation.

## Statistical physics

the branch of physics concerned with explaining the large-scale behavior of systems in terms of the collective action of their constituent elements.

## Universality

a property of large classes of dynamical systems whereby their macroscopic properties are independent of many of their microscopic parameters.
