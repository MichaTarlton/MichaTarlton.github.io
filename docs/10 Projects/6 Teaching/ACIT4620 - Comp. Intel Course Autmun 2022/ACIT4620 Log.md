## FAQs for Assignment 2 and the final

### A2:
1. Do we work on the same topic as the first assignment, or are we assigned new ones? If so, where can I find my given topic?
	- New topics have been  assigned. They are currently in the announcements.
	- 
2. Do we remain in the same group as the first assignment?
	- Yes

3. I really would like to work on my own because of my work schedule. I can only work on the project in the evenings and during weekends, and in no way can I meaningfully cooperate with teammates. I was allowed to work alone for other courses. Is it truly not possible to have a one-man group?

### Final
What's the exam going to be like?
- Mix of long and short answer questions

Anything practical, e.g. calculating backprop or CNN kernels?
- There will be some calculations but, not sure how complicated they will be

We have had no exercises to guide us so far.
- 
Do we have access to previous exams anywhere?
- No, unfortunately not.

The exam will cover all topics in the slides. You will be expected to have a diversity of knowledge, not *just* what you specialized in over the course.

## Plan for presentations today
Each person planned will have 8 minutes to present and 2 minutes for QnA from someone on their team.
After the 4th speaker, we will take a 10 minute break and then subsequently resume the last 5 presentations.
Please be able to present from your own laptop. A HDMI cable will be available for connecting

## Assessment Criteria for mandatory assignment 1
- Completeness and readability of the written report 
	- (Executive Summary + account of 3 main points);
- Oral presentation quality: 
	- evidence of understanding and critically analyzing the article, 
	- clarity and brevity of your presentation and/or arguments;
- Wow: for making TA/lecturer say “Wow!”.
### Additional
-   Importance of the topic to the field
-   Technical content: 
	- main work in the paper clearly explained, 
	- accuracy of technical information, 
	- etc.
-   Style and clarity: 
	- grammar, 
	- conciseness, 
	- readability, 
	- etc.
-   Completeness: 
	- sufficient level of detail, 
	- awareness of other relevant research, 
	- etc.

> In addition to the Assessment Criteria specified in the guidelines for Assignments 1 and 2, you may also consider to use additional (hopefully more specific) grading criteria, such as:
	> **(See above)**
> Pls note that for both Mandatory Assignments we have binary grading scale: either Approved or Not Approved. As I said earlier, I fully trust your evaluation results. Hopefully most students can pass successfully the two assignments (‘Obligs’).

## Need to make an announcement in canvas


In the meantime, take a look at the slides and take note of any subject that sound interesting to you, and then use the suggested reading to investigate the topic. 

I.e. is there is an assignment this week, it is to research a topic you find interesting, from what has been mentioned in class.

Email us any further questions

Thanks for your message. It is nice to know that you have background in information theory and programming which is certainly connected to AI.

First, some info about the ACIT course for you:

My Master-level course ACIT4620 (URL: [https://student.oslomet.no/en/studier/-/studieinfo/emne/ACIT4620/2022/H%C3%98ST](https://tr.cloudmagic.com/h/v6/link-track/1.0/1660748412155198-8e70c82c-e50e-d29d-f20e-3ed4b941fb86/1660748398/858a3b70b4ecfb1d293c6c654b01ed8d/9e4039c93334e3a4d291c9eddb3dd0ee/a9499928ed5994077c20c99af99963b1?redirect_uri=https://student.oslomet.no/en/studier/-/studieinfo/emne/ACIT4620/2022/H%C3%98ST)) for this Fall semester will take place on campus between Aug. 23 - Nov. 15.

I hope that you could work as a TA for the course. Each TA is expected to spend 20-30 hrs per month (on Tuesdays, starting from next Tuesday) on the job (the main duties are to be responsible for the lab sessions and Q&A for the students who may raise questions to the prior lectures on the same day, 9:00-11:30). Each lab session on Tuesdays lasts for about 2 hrs (12:15 – 14:15).

Could we have a short meeting in my office (P35 – PS326) this Friday afternoon?
