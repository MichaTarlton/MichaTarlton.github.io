## Abstract

Timing plays a crucial role in sensorimotor function. However, the neural mechanisms that enable the brain to flexibly measure and reproduce time intervals are not known. We recorded neural activity in parietal cortex of monkeys in a time reproduction task. Monkeys were trained to measure and immediately afterward reproduce different sample intervals. While measuring an interval, neural responses had a nonlinear profile that increased with the duration of the sample interval. Activity was reset during the transition from measurement to production and was followed by a ramping activity whose slope encoded the previously measured sample interval. We found that firing rates at the end of the measurement epoch were correlated with both the slope of the ramp and the monkey's corresponding production interval on a trial-by-trial basis. Analysis of response dynamics further linked the rate of change of firing rates in the measurement epoch to the slope of the ramp in the production epoch. These observations suggest that, during time reproduction, an interval is measured prospectively in relation to the desired motor plan to reproduce that interval.

**Figure 1. The Ready, Set, Go (RSG) task and behavior**

(A) Sequence of events during a trial. The monkey fixated a central spot. A saccade target was then presented in the response field (RF) of the neuron (gray zone) followed in succession by two transiently flashed peripheral cues (Ready followed by Set). The monkey then made an eye movement to the saccade target. To receive maximum reward, monkeys were required to time their saccade to the target so as to match the time interval between Set and saccade (production interval) to the interval between Ready and Set (sample interval). The target changed color to green on successful trials. (B) Sample intervals were drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with 10 values ranging between 529 and 1059 ms. (C) Reward schedule. The width of the window for which animals received liquid reward (green area) scaled with the sample interval (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The amount of reward within this window increased linearly with accuracy, as shown schematically by the size of liquid drops to the right. No feedback or reward was provided for production intervals outside the green region. (D) Production interval as a function of sample interval. Mean production intervals (open and filled circles) for the two monkeys (Yo and Wi) are plotted as a function of sample interval (SEM are smaller than the circles). Gray histograms show the distribution of production intervals for each sample interval for both monkeys. On average, production intervals deviated from the line of equality (diagonal dashed line) and towards the mean of the sample interval distribution (horizontal dashed line). The inset shows the magnitude of the bias for the longest sample interval (ordinate) versus the bias for the shortest sample interval (abscissa) across the 58 recording sessions for the two animals (open and filled circles). The magnitude of the bias was significantly larger for the longest sample interval (37.08+/−5.55 ms; t-test, p<1e–7). (E) The fit (solid line) of a Bayesian model to the behavior of the two monkeys. Data points are replicated from panel A. The inset shows the Weber fractions associated with measurement and production noise derived from the fit of the Bayesian model to each behavioral session (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). (F) Comparison of the variability and bias of production intervals between the animals’ behavior and the Bayesian model across sessions. The bias (“average Bias”) was measured as the root-mean square of the production interval bias across all sample intervals. The variability (“average Var1/2”) was similarly measured as the root-mean square of the standard deviation across sample intervals. The data shows that the average Bias (black) and the average Var1/2 (red) predicted from the Bayesian model fits (ordinate) accurately captures the corresponding values derived from the animal’s behavior. The inset is a plot of average Var1/2 versus average Bias for all behavioral sessions, showing that monkeys’ behavior was stable across sessions.

**Figure 2. LIP electrophysiology in the RSG task**

(A) Recording site. On top, a macaque brain is shown schematically along with a coronal plane through the intraparietal sulcus (ips). The bottom panel shows the structural magnetic resonance image of a coronal section of one of the monkeys (Yo) after the placement of the recording cylinder. All recorded neurons were within the ventral portion of area LIP along the lateral bank of the ips (red). (B) Raster plot of the spiking activity of a single neuron from before the onset of the saccade target through completion of the saccadic eye movement. Each trial is displayed as a row of spikes (black tics) aligned to the time of Set. Colored symbols mark the times of target onset (blue), Ready (red), Set (orange), and when the saccade reaches the target (green). Trials are sorted by duration of the sample interval; the order was random in the experiment. (C) Response averages (N=58) aligned to the onset of Ready. Sample intervals are indicated by colors (see legend at E). Each trace terminates at the time of the corresponding Set, indicated by a filled circle. After an initial decline, activity increased monotonically with elapsed time. (D) Response averages aligned to the time of Set. After Set, responses underwent a stereotyped dip and then diverged according to the sample interval. Filled colored circles are identical to those in A. (E) Response averages aligned to the time of saccade. Firing rate increased towards a common plateau approximately 200 ms before saccade initiation. The build-up of firing rate was shallower for longer sample intervals.

**Figure 3. Representation of the sample interval in the RSG task in LIP activity**

(A) Average firing rate from 100 ms before to 50 ms after Set (Set activity), as a function of sample interval. Firing rate near the time of Set increased monotonically with elapsed time. Error bars are SEM (N=58 neurons). For each neuron, we computed the slope of the regression line relating Set activity to sample interval. Inset histogram shows the distribution of slopes across 58 neurons. Dashed line indicates the mean regression slope; filled bars indicate slopes significantly different from zero (regression; t-test, p<0.05 for 22/58 cells). (B) Average build-up rate of the neural response from 500 to 200 ms before the saccade, as a function of sample interval. The build-up was more gradual with longer sample intervals. Error bars are SEM (N=58 neurons). Inset histogram shows the distribution of regression coefficient in a linear regression of the build-up rate against sample interval for 58 neurons. Dashed line indicates mean; filled bars indicate slopes significantly different from zero (regression; t-test, p<0.05 for 40/58 cells).

**Figure 4. The Ready, Go (RG) control experiment**

(A) Task design. The animal had to make a saccade to visual target 1588 ms after Ready. To make the sensory events of the RG and RSG tasks identical, a Set cue was also presented in the RG task. The interval between Ready and Set was drawn randomly from the same distribution used in the RSG task (Fig, 1B). (B) Animals’ behavior in the RG task. The behavior is plotted in the same format as in the RSG task (Figure 1D); i.e., the Set-saccade intervals as a function of the Ready-Set interval. In this task, maximum reward was given when the Ready-saccade interval (i.e., the sum of the Ready-Set and Set-saccade intervals) was 1588 ms (anti-diagonal). As expected, the Set-saccade intervals were on average shorter for longer Ready-Set intervals. However, saccade times exhibited systematic biases away form the anti-diagonal. (C–E) The time course of average population activity (N=39) plotted in the same format as in Fig. 2C–E.

**Figure 5. Comparison of LIP responses in the RSG and RG tasks**

The black and gray traces show the average LIP activity between Ready and Set in the RSG and RG tasks, respectively. The spike train from each trial was convolved with a 50 ms boxcar filter, and the smoothed firing rates were used to compute a running mean across neurons and trials that combined all spikes elicited after Ready and before 50 ms after Set. The superimposed red curves are fits based on the preplanning model. Each red trace is a piecewise linear function with 10 line segments (for 10 sample intervals). The slope of each line segment was derived directly from the corresponding ramping activity in the production epoch. Specifically, the slope of the line segment between each pair of consecutive sample intervals, ti and ti+1, was equal to the slope of the ramping activity associated with reproducing ti. We then used linear regression (i.e., two parameters: offset and scaling) to fit this piecewise linear function to LIP firing rates.

**Figure 6. Model comparison**

Comparison of the activity profile in the RSG task (black traces, same in all panels) from 300 ms after Ready to the time of the latest possible Set with predictions of different models (red). The models are constructed as a linear function of (A) the subjective hazard of the Set, (B) the expected reward, (C) the expected time of reward, (D) the Bayesian estimate of the sample interval, and (E) the preplanning model in which the instantaneous slope predicts the slope of the corresponding ramping activity in the production epoch.
