# Title:
## Neural Oscillatory Models for Multiscalar Timing Representations in Novel Reinforcement Learning Automata

# Authors:
## Michael Tarlton, Anis Yazidi, Gustavo Borges Mello



# Abstract:

I am proposing this as my abstract:

> Striatal Beat Frequency Models [[@matellNeuropsychologicalMechanismsInterval2000]] [[@yinOscillationCoincidenceDetectionModels2022]] propose an internal basis of interval timing at multiple scales in the milliseconds-to-minutes range, via a network of oscillatory circuits through the Cortico-Thalamic-Basal Ganglia loop. These regions provide timed pulses to downstream regions, which thereafter act as predictive signals of meaningful stimuli. This may also be replicated in more localized regions which are phase locked to a particular task or timing association. At the onset of a ‘to-be-timed’ signal (the detection of meaningful stimuli or environmental event), core oscillatory neuron populations reset their phase/synchronize and begin oscillating at their endogenous periodicities. The phase patterns are then "recorded" in relation to some "stop" event given by some reinforcement.

> To our knowledge this paradigm has yet to be implemented in a standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm or further machine learning models with emphasis on optimizing behavior in time. Replicating a naïve model of oscillatory timing in an RL framework may establish a new method of timing adaptation in simple automata systems. This may also serve to inform future Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), which aim to harness the strengths of the brain’s spiking properties, but at current, poorly reach the full potential spike timing communications.

> Here we propose implementation of a simple oscillatory RL model which is reinforced by learning the correct action at rewarded intervals of time, where a decision-making automata represents the “executive” region, and is stimulated to action by rudimentary sub-automata with locked phase cycles, the latter representing the upstream oscillatory cores. This RL algorithm aims to replicate animal behavior and activity found in the Peak Interval procedure task [[@hasegawaModelMultisecondTiming2015]] and compare it with real-world animal studies.
