Uur Contribution to Continual Leavning
Oav groject aims to create multiple cyclic representations of time. For RL these timeframes will be held in relation to a task or tasks.
In CL there is need to give tasks unique, refrievable, and shared reprezentation in the latent model space, By ascociating tasks with timeframes particukr to the task, we may be able to create befter task-action mapings in the model,

"Tasus" here may he made up of mutiple subtasks? The full distribution of " problem, I will call the "problem" while the "tasu" are the sunllest nuid of some max atate-action impoping. Every task mill likely have some unigne time frame in which if cycles. Such as the hird vistifing Feeding location $A$, which replenishes every 10 minutes.
While feeding lacation B repleniskes every 15 minutes

The feeding of both these site would coustifute two differen tasks with two different timecycles associated to them

If taking a puge from striatal Beat frequency model, these tasu time cycles intiate@ some ctimulas associated wf the tusk and so could have a very literal attachment to tho "frame" of the cydic tinefromme
