## Email from Tine
> I have added a welcome letter for you with the information that you need about what to do next.
> 
> I would prioritize to fill out the application for admission to the PhD programme. You have to fill out the form (link in the welcome letter), and add all the attachments which is described in the application form. Your supervisors will go through the application when you are ready to submit it, they will then send it to Laurence (department leader). She will submit it upon approval, and it will be processed by the DGU which will make a decision regarding admission to the PhD programme.
  > 
> We only have one meeting left in the DGU before the summer. The next meeting will be held at 13 June with submission deadline 23 May.
> 
> The next meeting after this will probably be in late August because of the summer holidays in July.
