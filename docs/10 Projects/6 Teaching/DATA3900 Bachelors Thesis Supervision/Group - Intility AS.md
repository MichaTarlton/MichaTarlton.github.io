## Project Aims
The task is to develop a portal that makes it easier for Intility's developers to use Intility's Message Broker Platform. From the portal, developers must be able to:
- Create and manage your own topics 
- Create and manage your own subscriptions 
- See simple statistics on topics

In addition to this, there is a lot of other functionality that can and should be added to the portal, but we want the group to figure this out together with supervisors and through conversations with other developers at Intility.

The group should have experience/interest in both frontend and backend. There is no requirement for experience with specific development languages or technologies, but it is desirable that the group uses Intility's platform for development. Here you will get access to the same tools that Intility's developers use, as well as the opportunity to learn from Intility's developers.
