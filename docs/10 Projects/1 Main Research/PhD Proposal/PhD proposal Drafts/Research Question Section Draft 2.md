The key question we want to answer, is how can multiple timescales and event associations can be represented in a viable model of reward and learning. Specifically, how can we exploit the innate properties of multifold temporal dynamics found in spiking neural networks, to model a reinforcement learning scheme capable of learning in a complex hyperspace of both time and environmental variables.

An animal agent must associate multiple frames of reference in time with actions to be taken, and potential risk / reward scenarios. Multiple objectives, with their own overlapping and nested time frames, must be considered by the animal, based on the associations and reinforcements made between the animal’s behavior and how it recognizes scales of time. 

Can these timescales be recognized by the agent? Not only is the learning dependent on association between event and time, but as well on recognition of different intervals of time. Additionally, correct association between the appropriate time interval and the relevant event must be learned. 

The association between time and events has been addressable, by machine learning methods up until now, only in short time scales and to single tasks. We ask if it is possible to create a learning method to optimize the behavior of an agent, not only  in regard to the short term, but the actions required in the short term to maximally a long term policy. 

Can we create a model, which learn simultaneous state-action optimizations for multiple reference frames of time, the same way an animal may choose its behaviors, not only on the time of day, but the time of year. Can this model correctly associate reward with actions made, not most recently, but most relevant over the whole time-space.

Assuming, we achieve our goal of encoding multiple, flexible, timescales in SNNs to amplify the abilities of DRL, we can:
→ Create a model which will self-teach
→ Do so for a large state, action, reward, and time relation space
→ Optimize for multiple objectives in both the environment and time

By result of this research, we will have developed:
→ Novel discoveries in SNN temporal dynamics
→ Novel DRL-SNN architecture design and models
→ Novel concept mechanisms to relate to biological systems and implement in neuromorphic hardware
