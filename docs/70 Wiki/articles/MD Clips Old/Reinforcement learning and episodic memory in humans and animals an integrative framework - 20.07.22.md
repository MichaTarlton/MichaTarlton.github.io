## Abstract

We review the psychology and neuroscience of reinforcement learning (RL), which has witnessed significant progress in the last two decades, enabled by the comprehensive experimental study of simple learning and decision-making tasks. However, the simplicity of these tasks misses important aspects of reinforcement learning in the real world: (i) State spaces are high-dimensional, continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (ii) data are relatively sparse: indeed precisely the same situation may never be encountered twice; and also that (iii) rewards depend on long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the classical assumptions that make RL tractable.

A seemingly distinct challenge is that, cognitively, these theories have largely connected with procedural and semantic memory: how knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually from many experiences can drive choice. This misses many aspects of memory related to traces of individual events, such as episodic memory. We suggest that these two gaps are related. In particular, the computational challenges can be dealt with, in part, by endowing RL systems with episodic memory, allowing them to (i) efficiently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (ii) learn with very little data, and (iii) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards. We review the computational theory underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support it. Our proposal suggests that the ubiquitous and diverse roles of memory in RL may function as part of an integrated learning system.

## Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) is the process by which organisms learn, by trial and error, to predict and acquire reward. What makes this challenging, from a computational point of view, is that actions have long-term effects on future reward (e.g., failing to save may lead to penury later in life; drinking stagnant water may slake thirst at the expense of later illness). Further, these deferred consequences may depend critically on other, subsequent actions and events: getting admitted to college pays off only if one manages to graduate. This sequential dependency greatly compounds the classic “curse of dimensionality” ([Bellman, 1957](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R5)) by extending it over time. Clearly, biological organisms cannot try every possible sequence of actions. By making certain simplifying assumptions about the structure of the environment, computer scientists have designed efficient algorithms that are guaranteed to find the optimal behavioral policy. The discovery that the brain uses one (indeed several) of these algorithms is one of the great success stories of modern cognitive and computational neuroscience.

Two decades of research have buttressed this picture, with converging evidence from behavioral, neural and computational studies. One key advance has been the extension of the classic story in ways that enriched its content, both computational and cognitive. In particular, early celebrated work on RL focused on a dopaminergic and striatal system for simple, incremental learning of action values, known as model-free learning ([Montague et al., 1996](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R84); [Houk et al., 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R60); [Schultz et al., 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R109)). Recent work has extended this view to encompass additional processes for more deliberative, so-called model-based evaluation ([Daw, Niv & Dayan, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R25); [Dolan & Dayan, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R32)). This increases the computational capability of the theories – allowing them, for instance, to choose more effectively in novel or changed circumstances – and also situates them in relation to a broader framework of research in the cognitive neuroscience of memory. Model-based learning formalizes how organisms employ knowledge about the world – maps or models of task contingencies – in the service of evaluating actions. This dovetails with research on multiple memory systems: e.g., distinguishing a striatal procedural learning system from a hippocampal declarative one ([Eichenbaum & Cohen, 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R34); [Poldrack et al., 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R100)), each with several properties that echo their decision making counterparts. The emerging relationship between RL and the memory systems that likely subserve it has been illuminating for both areas.

Despite this success, we are still far from understanding how real-world RL works, either cognitively or computationally. Here, we suggest that these two sets of gaps have a common answer.

Cognitively, RL has long embraced procedural learning and more recently semantic memory (in the sense of knowledge of facts about the world that typically are viewed as abstracted from many experiences, like the map of a well-explored maze). But it has had limited contact with another prominent sort of memory: *episodic memories* connecting different aspects of individual events the organism experienced at a particular time and place ([Tulving, 1972](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R129)). Such traces seem, in principle, relevant to decisions; a goal of this review is to clarify what specific advantages they might confer.

Computationally, biological RL is still greatly hobbled by the restrictive formal assumptions that underpin it. With few exceptions, the kinds of experimental tasks that have been used to study RL are quintessentially “toy” problems: They are designed to isolate certain computations in a well-controlled setting, but they do not grapple with the complexity of many decision problems faced by organisms in their natural environments. In particular: (i) Real state spaces are high-dimensional, continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (ii) data are relatively sparse: indeed precisely the same situation will never be encountered twice; and also that (iii) rewards depend on long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the classical assumptions that make RL tractable.

Intuitively, these implications can be understood by considering the problem of investing in the stock market. The state of the stock market is high-dimensional and continuous, such that any given state is unlikely to be repeated (i.e., the market history sparsely samples the state space). Furthermore, the long-term consequences of an investment decision depend on forces that are only partially observable (e.g., the strategies of other investors). The kinds of algorithms that have been imputed to the brain will break down when confronted with this sort of real-world complexity. Since organisms clearly find a way to cope with this complexity, we are left with the conundrum that much of our understanding about RL in the brain may in fact be irrelevant to important aspects of how organisms naturally behave.

In this review, we suggest that one computational answer to this conundrum is to look to a different and complementary set of algorithmic approaches than those typically examined in cognitive neuroscience – those based on nonparametric estimation, kernel-, or instance-based methods. These methods are statistically well-suited for dealing with sparse, arbitrarily structured, trial-unique data. Moreover, because they ultimately base their estimates on records of individual events, they also may clarify the missing links between decision making and episodic memory. These links are relatively underexplored, though they relate to a number of other ideas, and make contact with other empirical literatures, which therefore form the balance of our review. The key idea (building on one from [Lengyel and Dayan, 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R75)) is that episodic memory could provide detailed and temporally extended snapshots of the interdependency of actions and outcomes from individual experiences, and this information may be a reliable guide to decision-making precisely in situations where classical algorithms break down. Episodic memory may thus enable organisms to (i) efficiently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (ii) learn with very little data, and (iii) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards.

In what follows, we review the current picture of RL in neuroscience and psychology, and lay out the main arguments, both theoretical and empirical, that make this picture at best incomplete. We then describe a theoretical framework for augmenting RL with additional systems based on nonparametric estimation which we tentatively identify with episodic memory. We consider the computational implications of this approach, and review the available evidence related to this framework and its connection to earlier ideas.

## Reinforcement learning: the current picture

We begin this section with a brief overview of the RL problem formalism and standard algorithmic solutions, and then review behavioral and neural evidence that the brain implements these algorithms. For other, more extensive reviews of this material, see [Niv (2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R87); [Dolan & Dayan (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R32); and a trilogy of textbook chapters ([Daw and Tobler, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R27); [Daw, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R21); Daw and O’Doherty 2013). Our goal here is mainly to motivate a more prospective review of possible connections with additional areas of research.

### Markov decision processes

In machine learning, RL concerns the study of learned optimal control, primarily in multistep (“sequential”) decision problems ([Sutton and Barto, 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R125); Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1997). Most classic work concerns a formal class of tasks known as Markov decision processes (MDPs). MDPs are formal models of multi-step decision tasks like spatial navigation, games like Tetris, or scheduling problems as in factories; in a pinch (neglecting some game-theoretic aspects of the opponent’s behavior) they also model multi-step multiplayer games like chess. The goal of RL is typically to learn, by trial and error, to make optimal choices in an initially unknown MDP.

Formally, MDPs are expressed in terms of discrete states *s* and actions *a*, and numeric rewards *r*. As we will see, much of the research in psychology and neuroscience surrounding these models turns on the tricky relationship between these formal objects and real-world situations, behaviors, and outcomes. But informally, states are like situations in a task (e.g., locations in a spatial maze), actions are like behavioral choices (turn left or right), and rewards are a measure of the utility obtained in some state (a high value for food obtained at some location, if one is hungry).

An MDP consists of a series of discrete timesteps, in which the agent observes some state *st* of the environment, receives some reward *rt*, and chooses some action *at*. The agent’s goal is to choose actions at each step so as to maximize the expected cumulative future rewards, discounted (exponentially by decay factor *γ* < 1) for delay, i.e. the sum *rt* + *γrt*+1 + *γ*2*r*t+2 + ⋯ of future rewards.

Thus, the goal is not simply to maximize the immediate reward of an action, but instead the cumulative reward (the “return”), summed over all future timesteps. Actions influence longer-run reward expectancy because, in an MDP, each successor state *st*+1 is drawn from a probability distribution *P*(*st*+1 | *st*, *at*) that depends on the current state and action; and rewards at each step are generated according to a probability distribution *P*(*rt*|*st*) that depends on the current state. Informally, what this means is that the agent navigates the states (like positions in a maze) and harvests rewards by choosing actions. Each action affects not just the current reward, but by affecting the next state also sets the stage for subsequent ones. Conversely, because the consequences of an action for cumulative reward depend also on subsequent states and actions, choosing optimally can be quite involved.

What makes these problems nevertheless tractably solvable is the eponymous feature of MDPs, the *Markov conditional independence property*: At any timestep *t*, all future states and rewards depend only on the current state and action, via the probability distributions given above. Thus, importantly, conditional only on the present state and action, all future events are independent of all preceding events. This permits a recursive expression for the *state-action value function* (the sum of future rewards expected for taking some action in some state: the quantity that is the goal of optimization):

[Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1) is a form of the Bellman equation ([Bellman, 1957](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R5)), versions of which underlie most classical RL algorithms. Here, it says that the expected future reward for taking action *at* in state *st* (then following some *policy π* thereafter) is given by the sum of two terms: the current reward, and the second term, which stands in for all the remaining rewards *γrt*+1 + *γr*2*t*+2 + ⋯. The insight is that this sum is itself just the value *Q* of the subsequent state, averaged over possible successors according to their probability.

A chief problem in RL is how to choose advantageously given the deferred consequences of one’s actions. One way to solve this problem is to focus on *predicting* those consequences, via learning to estimate *Qπ*(*st*, *at*) (or some closely related quantity) from experience with rewards, states, and actions in the MDP. Given a good estimate of the value function, you can choose the action with the best return simply by comparing values across candidate actions. Many RL algorithms rely on variations on this basic logic. (We omit some details related to the dependence of *Q* on the continuation policy *π*; for our purposes, imagine that by learning *Q* and choosing according to it, we gradually improve our prevailing action selection policy, which in turn drives an updated *Q* until we arrive at the best policy.)

### Model-based and model-free algorithms

There are two main classes of algorithms for RL based on [Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1), which focus on either the left- or right-hand side of the equal sign in that equation. First, it is possible to use experience to estimate the “one-step” reward and state transition distributions *P*(*rt*|*st*) and *P*(*st*+1 | *st*, *at*), which together are known as an *internal model* of the MDP. Note that these concern only immediate events – which rewards or states follow other states, and are thus easy to learn from local experience, essentially by counting. Given these, in turn, it is possible iteratively to expand the right-hand side of [Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1) to compute the state-action value for any state and candidate action. Algorithms for doing this, such as value iteration, essentially work by “mental simulation,” enumerating the possible sequences of states that are expected to follow a starting state and action, summing the rewards expected along them, and using the learned model to keep track of their probability. (See [Daw and Dayan, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R23), for a detailed presentation.)

This approach is known as *model-based learning* due to its reliance on the internal model. Its main advantage is the simplicity of learning, but its main disadvantage is that this simplicity is offset by computational complexity at choice time, since producing state-action values depends on extensive computation over many branching possible paths.

An alternative approach is to eschew learning a world model, and instead learn a table of long-run state-action values *Q* (the left hand side of [Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1)) directly from experience. The discovery of algorithms for accomplishing such *model-free* RL (in particular, the family of temporal-difference, TD, learning algorithms; Sutton 1990) was a major advance in machine learning that continues to provide the foundation for modern applications (e.g., [Mnih et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R83)).

Briefly, these algorithms use experienced states, actions and rewards to compute *samples* of the right hand side of [Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1), and average these to update a table of long-run reward predictions. More particularly, many algorithms are based on the *temporal difference reward prediction error* occasioned by comparing the value *Q*(*st*, *at*) to a sample computed one timestep later:

*δ**t* = *r**t* + *γ**Q*(*s**t*+1, *a**t*+1)−*Q*(*s**t*, *a**t*)

\[2\]

When the value function is well estimated, this difference should on average be zero (because *Q*(*st*, *at*) should in expectation equal *rt* + *γQ*(*st*+1, *at*+1) by [Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1)). When error is nonzero, stored *Q*s can be updated to reduce it.

Choice is, accordingly, much simpler using model-free algorithms compared to model-based algorithms, because the long-run values are already computed, and need only be compared to find the best action. However, as we will discuss further, these computational savings come at a cost of inflexibility and less efficient learning.

### Model-free learning in the brain

The initial and still most celebrated success of RL theory in neuroscience was the observation that the firing of dopamine neurons in the midbrain of monkeys behaving for reward resembles the reward prediction error of [Equation 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD2) ([Montague et al., 1996](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R84); [Houk et al., 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R60); [Schultz et al., 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R109)), suggesting that the brain may use this signal for RL. The trial-trial fluctuations in this signal track the model quite precisely ([Bayer & Glimcher, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R4)), and can also be measured in rodents using both physiology and voltammetry ([Cohen et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R17); [Hart et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R56)). A similar signal can also be measured in the ventral striatum (a key dopamine target) in humans using fMRI (e.g., [Hare et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R55)). Although fMRI measurements are not specific to the underlying neural causes, dopaminergic involvement in these prediction error correlates is suggested by findings that they are modulated by dopaminergic medication ([Pessiglione et al., 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R98)) and by Parkinson’s disease ([Schoenberg et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R108)), which is marked by the relatively selective degeneration of dopaminergic nuclei.

It is believed that dopamine drives learning about actions by modulating plasticity at its targets, notably medium spiny neurons in striatum ([Frank et al., 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R40)). Via their projections to other basal ganglia nuclei (and ultimately to motor cortex), these neurons drive elicitation and withholding of behavior ([Alexander and Crutcher, 1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R2)). Accordingly, Parkinson’s disease and dopamine replacement therapy in humans modulate learning in RL tasks ([Frank et al., 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R40); [Shohamy et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R112)). More temporally specific optogenetic elicitation and suppression of dopaminergic responses in rodents also drives learning in tasks specifically designed to isolate error-driven learning ([Steinberg et al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R120); [Parker et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R96)). These studies refine an earlier literature using less selective electrical or pharmacological stimulation of the systems; notably, drugs of abuse invariably agonize dopamine as a common link of effect. This suggests the hypothesis that their reinforcing effects are ultimately driven by the same RL mechanisms discussed here ([Redish, 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R102); [Everitt and Robbins, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R37)).

The behavioral experiments discussed thus far mainly involve non-sequential decision tasks, such as one-step “bandit” tasks in which a subject repeatedly chooses between a set of actions (different slot machines) and receives reward or punishment. Indeed, the trial-by-trial dependency of choices on rewards in such tasks is quantitatively consistent with the pattern predicted by error-driven learning in both monkeys ([Lau and Glimcher, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R73)) and humans ([Seymour et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R110)). However, model-free learning by [Equation 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD2) makes more specific and characteristic predictions about the progression of learning across states in multistep, sequential tasks. The predicted patterns have been confirmed to be present in humans ([Fu and Anderson, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R41); [Daw et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R24)), but not exclusively. Indeed, long before the advent of the neurophysiological models, behavioral psychologists had established that basic TD learning cannot by itself explain a number of learning effects, a point to which we turn next.

### Model-based learning in the brain

Although model-free and model-based algorithms both ultimately converge to optimal value predictions (under various technical assumptions and in the theoretical limit of infinite experience in a fixed MDP; e.g., Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1997), they differ in the trial-by-trial dynamics by which they approach the solution. One difference between model-free and model-based algorithms for learning from [Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1), is related to the fact that because the model-free algorithms learn long-run action values by sampling them directly along experienced trajectories. For this reason, they can in some cases fail to integrate information encountered in different trajectories (e.g., separate trials or task stages).

This basic insight has been investigated using tasks involving staged sequences of experience, ordered in a way to defeat a model-free learner. For instance, in latent learning ([Tolman, 1948](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R128); [Glascher et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R50), and a similar task called sensory preconditioning, [Brogden, 1939](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R13); [Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R134)), organisms are first pre-exposed to the state-action contingencies in an environment without any rewards (e.g., explore a maze), then subsequently learn that reward is available at a particular location.

For a model-based learner, this experience has the effect of teaching them first the transition function *P*(*st*+1 | *st*, *at*), i.e. the map of the maze, and then, separately, the reward function *P*(*rt*|*st*). Together, this information enables them in a subsequent probe phase to navigate to reward from any location, by evaluating [Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1). However, for a model-free learner, the pre-exposure stage teaches them nothing useful for the probe (only that *Q* is everywhere zero); in particular, since they don’t separately learn a representation of the map of the maze (the state transition distribution), they must learn the navigation task from scratch when reward is introduced.

Humans and even rodents can, at least under some circumstances, successfully integrate these experiences, demonstrated in this case by facilitated navigation learning in groups who received the pre-exposure ([Tolman, 1948](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R128); [Glascher et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R50)). These results, and logically similar ones involving studying whether animals require additional experience to adjust their decisions following changes in reward value (e.g., outcome devaluation) or task contingencies (introduction of blockades or shortcuts; contingency degradation) have been taken to reject model-free RL, at least as a complete account of behavior ([Dickinson and Balleine, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R30); [Daw et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R25)).

However, the same types of experiments actually do support the predictions of model-free learning mechanisms like TD, in that under other circumstances, organisms *fail* as the theories predict to integrate well (but separately) learned information about contingencies and rewards. For instance, following *overtraining* on lever-pressing for food, rodents will lever-press even after the outcome is devalued by satiety ([Adams, 1982](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R1)), though less thoroughly trained animals can successfully adjust. In psychology, these two sorts of behaviors (incapable and capable of integration, respectively) are known as *habitual* and *goal-directed*. Lesion studies in rodents suggest that they are dependent on discrete networks in the brain, involving different parts of frontal cortex and striatum (see Daw & O’Doherty, 2013 for review).

Altogether, the predictions of model-free learning and the prediction error theories of dopamine are well matched to habitual behavior, but fail to account for the additional category of goal-directed behavior and the ability of organisms to integrate experiences. This led to the suggestion ([Daw et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R25)) that the latter behavior might be understood in terms of model-based learning alongside the model-free system and competing to control behavioral output. This proposal put hitherto looser ideas about deliberative behavior and cognitive maps on more equal quantitative footing with the more specific neurocomputational theories of habitual learning, enabling further investigation of its properties.

For instance, with more specific characterizations of both sorts of learning, it is possible to dissociate trial-by-trial behavioral adjustments and neural correlates of decision variables like *Q* associated with either learning rule in multistep decision tasks (e.g., two-step, three-state MDPs; [Daw et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R24)). Experiments using this technique have verified that signatures of both types of learning coexist in humans. Their prevalence can be manipulated situationally ([Otto et al., 2013a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R93),[b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R94)); varies across individuals (e.g., with symptoms of compulsive disorders such as drug abuse; [Gillan et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R49)); and tracks “prospective” representation of future states measured in fMRI at choice time (consistent with choice-time evaluation via mental simulation; [Doll et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R33)). Research with elaborated multi-step decision tasks has also begun to shed light on computational shortcuts by which the brain manages to compute the expected reward ([Dezfouli and Balleine, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R29); [Diuk et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R31); [Huys et al, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R61); [Cushman and Morris, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R20); [Solway & Botvinick, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R117)).

Less is yet known about the neural circuits supporting putatively model-based behavior. Particularly in human neuroimaging, there appears to be more overlap between neural signals associated with model-based and model-free learning than might have been expected on the basis of lesion work. For instance, prediction error signals in human striatum ([Daw et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R24)) and rodent dopamine neurons ([Sadacca et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R105)) both reflect integrated, model-based valuations. (This is surprising insofar as those signals provide the foundation for the standard model-free account discussed above.) As discussed further below, results like this might suggest that the systems interact more cooperatively in the intact than the lesioned brain; that model-based computations are built in part by leveraging phylogenetically earlier model-based circuitry; that there is more of a continuum between them; and/or that the integration of value that is taken as a signature of model-based computation is actually heterogeneous and may occur via a number of different mechanisms at different times ([Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R134); [Gershman et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R46); [Shohamy & Daw, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R111)).

Other data point to the hippocampus as a key player in model-based RL. The model-free vs. model-based distinction appears to track a similar dichotomy in the study of multiple memory systems, which in broad terms distinguishes a rigid striatal procedural learning system from a more flexible declarative memory system associated with the hippocampus ([Squire, 1992](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R118); [Gabrieli 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R42); [Knowlton et al., 1996](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R69)). A number of particular aspects of hippocampal function also suggest it as a candidate site for world models as envisioned in RL. For spatial navigation, it has long been viewed as a seat of cognitive maps ([O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R90)). Perhaps the most directly suggestive data concerning a potential neural circuit for model-based evaluation also come from spatial navigation tasks, in which representations of place cells in rodent hippocampus appear to “run ahead” of the animal during navigation and at choice points ([Johnson & Redish, 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R63); [Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R99). This prospective activity has been suggested to instantiate a “search” of future trajectories to support model-based evaluation (e.g., decision-time computation of [Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1)). However, this phenomenon has yet to be specifically linked to choice behaviors (like latent learning or other integrative tasks) that demonstrate model-based evaluation.

Outside space, the hippocampus is also associated with more abstract relational information reminiscent of the state transition function ([Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R34); [Shohamy et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R113)). But perhaps the most well-known function of the hippocampus is the formation of episodic memories, long-term, autobiographical snapshots of particular events. This function has also been linked to prospective construction of imagined future episodes, for planning or other decisions ([Schacter et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R106)). It has not, however, received as much attention in RL. Below we argue that it may underlie some decisions that appear “model-based.” The relationship between all these seemingly disparate aspects of hippocampal memory function is a deep conceptual issue and one of ongoing debate in the cognitive neuroscience of memory.

### Computational shortcomings of the current picture

The computational and neural mechanisms described above appear to be a reasonably well supported picture, albeit with some uncertainty related to the neural implementation of world modeling and integrative evaluation. However, it is quite unclear how these mechanisms could “scale up” to real-world tasks. It is not so much that the tasks that have been studied in the laboratory are small and artificial – though they are – it is that the very assumptions that allow RL to work well in these sorts of tasks are inapplicable to many richer, real-world settings.

Many of the issues arise out of the definition of the state *st*. Laboratory experiments typically involve at most a handful of discrete states and actions, which are clearly signaled to the subjects and designed to satisfy the Markov conditional independence property. Real world sensations rarely meet these conditions. The typical sensory experiences of an organism are both too vast and too impoverished to serve as *st* in algorithms based on [Equation 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD1). They are too vast because they are continuous, and high-dimensional, such that effective learning requires identifying the subset of relevant dimensions and generalizing appropriately across situations that will never exactly recur ([Niv et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R88)).

Real world sensations are *also* too impoverished because despite all the extraneous detail in one’s immediate sensory observations, they rarely satisfy the Markov property; i.e., other information observed in the past but not currently observable affects future state and reward expectancies. This happens routinely in real-world tasks; e.g., in navigation whenever two different locations look similar enough to be indistinguishable (“state aliasing”), or due to long-run dependencies between day-to-day events, such as when someone tells you they’ll be back tomorrow at noon for lunch. If the Markov property fails to hold for some putative state *s*, it is not possible to decompose the state-action value via the Bellman equation ([Equation 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#FD2)).

Of course there exists extensive machine learning work on how to cope with some of these circumstances. Particularly relevant for neuroscience is the theory of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs; [Kaebling et al., 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R66)), which treats Markov violations as arising from “latent” states that would satisfy the Markov property, but can only be indirectly (and perhaps ambiguously) observed. With training, one can learn to *infer* the identity of these states (which may indeed provide part of a theoretical basis for state representation for RL; [Daw et al., 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R22); [Rao, 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R101); [Gershman et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R45), [2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R47)), but only after having done so is one in anything like a firm position to learn action values. In what follows, we consider mechanisms that might be applicable earlier in learning, and also might be flexible and able to adapt in the face of ongoing learning about how to define the state, which dimensions are relevant and how to infer latent aspects.

## Episodic memory for nonparametric value function approximation

If the current computational picture of RL is incomplete, how can progress be made? One approach is to further examine what the brain’s memory systems might suggest about RL.

As already suggested, existing RL theories have recognized links to what in memory research is known as procedural memory (for model-free policies or action values) and to semantic declarative memories (for world maps or models). Strikingly, all these quantities represent statistical summaries extracted from a series of events – procedural knowledge of how to ride a bike, or semantic knowledge of what a typical breakfast might contain. In contrast, a great deal of research in memory concerns memory for one-shot events, from word lists to autobiographical events like your 30th birthday party or what you had for breakfast this morning. The remainder of this review considers how memories for individual events might serve RL, and in particular why it might help to enable RL to escape some of its previous weaknesses and the restrictive assumptions under which it operates.

Though an interesting computational object in the abstract, one-shot memories are not unique to long-term episodic memory. For instance, working memory clearly plays a role in maintaining and manipulating information briefly, as for phone numbers. It also arises in our review. However, we mainly have in mind long-term episodic memory, which apart from having a number of appealing computational features for RL is also associated with the hippocampus, whose other mnemonic roles are already implicated in model-based RL. (Though we are not yet in a position to entirely reconcile these functions, it is nevertheless clear that episodic aspects are conspicuously lacking from the current picture.)

Psychologically, episodic memory is associated with detailed autobiographical memories linking many different sensory features of an experience at a particular time and place, such as what you had for breakfast this morning ([Tulving, 1972](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R129)). Computationally, for the purpose of this review, we would stress the notion of a record of an individual event (like a trial in a task) and the connection between many aspects of that event, including multiple sensory dimensions and sensations experienced sequentially. Below, we reason about what sort of advantages episodic memories might confer on an organism’s decision making, and argue that they are well suited to the situations poorly handled by the mechanisms considered so far, and well linked to another class of estimation algorithm.

For this, we build on an earlier proposal, dubbed “episodic control” by [Lengyel and Dayan (2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R75), who suggested that episodic memories could be used to record, and later mimic, previously rewarding sequences of states and actions. Here we suggest a somewhat different computational rationale for a similar idea, which we call “episodic RL,” in which episodic memories are used to construct estimates to the state- or state-action value function (rather than for extracting policies, i.e. action sequences, directly). These evaluations can then be compared to derive choice policies in the usual way.

The previous section identified two difficulties with existing algorithms in real-world circumstances. First, the space of situations (“states”) is vast, and which features or dimensions of it are relevant to value prediction are not typically known in advance. Also, many RL systems harness the recursive structure of the Bellman equation, but the Markov assumptions that underpin this recursive structure are invalid in many real-world environments (e.g., when there are long-term dependencies). Memory for individual episodes can help ameliorate these problems by allowing for the later construction of a “nonparametric” approximation of the value function that need not precommit at the time of encoding to averaging with respect to particular relevant sensory dimensions, or to reliance on the Bellman equation for a particular choice of state.

To understand what this means, recall that the value of a state represents the cumulative future reward over a (possibly infinitely long) trajectory. Model-free algorithms store and update a running average of this value, and model-based algorithms compute the value on the fly using estimates of the reward and transition functions. These approaches are “parametric” in the sense that they estimate a set of parameters that specify the value function (cached values in the case of model-free control, model parameters in the case of model-based control). Once these parameters have been estimated, the raw data can be discarded.

Episodic RL keeps the raw data in memory and approximate state values by retrieving samples from memory. Intuitively, this works because the value of a state can be approximated simply by summing rewards collected along a remembered trajectory initiated in that state, or averaging such sums across several such trajectories. Because these trajectories are individual and temporally extended, they capture arbitrary long-range, non-Markovian dependencies among events. Moreover, as discussed below, this procedure allows for flexible and adaptive generalization in terms of what counts as a similar “state” for the purpose of forecasting value in novel circumstances.

Episodic RL is “nonparametric” in the sense that it does not rely on a fixed, parameterized form of the value function. The effective complexity of the approximation (i.e., the number of episodes) grows as more data are observed. This approach links to a well developed literature in statistics and machine learning on nonparametric estimation (see [Wasserman, 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R132), for a textbook treatment) and a more specialized set of applications of these techniques to value estimation in the RL setting (e.g., [Ormoneit & Sen, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R92); [Engel et al. 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R35)).

### Formalization of episodic reinforcement learning

The simplest implementation of episodic RL ([Figure 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/figure/F1/)) is to store individual trajectories in memory, and, when a familiar state is encountered, retrieve the set of trajectories that have followed each candidate action in that state, and average the rewards subsequently obtained to estimate the value of each action. Formally,

$<math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M3" display="block" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>π</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>a</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mrow><mo>[</mo><mstyle displaystyle="true"><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></munderover><mrow><msup><mi>γ</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>|</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow></mstyle><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>≈</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>M</mi></mfrac><mstyle displaystyle="true"><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>M</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mstyle></math>$

where *M* is the number of retrieved trajectories, *Rm* is the cumulative discounted return for each trajectory, and *π* is the prevailing policy. This approach works reasonably well when the state space is small and sequences are not very deep. However, there are several problems with this implementation when applied to more general environments (e.g., with large state spaces and long planning horizons). First, since it seems likely that only relatively short trajectories can be stored in memory (much work in memory concerns the segmentation of events between episodes; e.g., [Ezzyat & Davachi, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R38)), episodic RL may tend to be myopic, neglecting long-term future events due to truncation of the trace. Computationally, estimates of long-run reward based on sample trajectories also have large variance as the horizon grows longer, since increasing numbers of random events intervene along the way ([Kearns & Singh, 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R67)). Second, in complex or continuous state spaces, states may be rarely if ever revisited; thus, the controller needs a mechanism for generalization to new states.

**Schematic of different approaches to value computation**

(A) In model-free reinforcement learning, individual experiences are integrated into a cached value, which is then used to compute action values in a new state. Only cached values are stored in memory; individual experiences are discarded. Green triangle indicates the agent’s state, red crosses indicate rewards, and blue arrows indicate paths through the state space. (B) In episodic reinforcement learning, individual experiences, along with their associated returns, are retained in memory and retrieved at choice time. Each episodic trace is weighted by its similarity to the current state according to a kernel function. This kernel-weighted average implements a nonparametric value estimate.

The first problem can be addressed by combining episodic RL with the Bellman equation. Consider an agent who retrieves a set of *M* trajectories starting with action *a* in state *s*, and ending *N* timesteps later in some state *smN* which may differ for each episode. The value of this state can be expressed as follows:

$<math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M4" display="block" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>π</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>a</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>M</mi></mfrac><mstyle displaystyle="true"><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>M</mi></msubsup><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>γ</mi><mi>N</mi></msup><mstyle displaystyle="true"><msub><mo>∑</mo><mi>s</mi></msub><mrow><mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>|</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>N</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>π</mi></msub></mrow></mstyle><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>π</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>$

The first term in this equation represents the expected return from an episode of length *N*, and the second term represents the expected return after that trace has terminated. The second term could be computed using model-based or model-free value estimates, or by chaining together a sequence of episodes. Combining these terms allows episodic RL to correctly take into account the long-term consequences of a finite trajectory. Note that the individual sequences capture arbitrary long-run dependencies among events (up to their length), and a Markovian assumption is invoked only to knit them together. It is also possible to knit together shorter sequences, or in the limit, individual state transitions themselves each drawn from a set of sample episodes ([Ormoneit & Sen, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R92)), to the extent the Markovian assumption can be relied upon. Unlike traditional model-free approaches ([Sutton, 1988](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R123)), the decision of how heavily to rely on the Markovian assumption need not be made when experience is first acquired, but instead later, at choice time, when it is used to compute decision variables. This means this decision can be informed by additional experience in the interim.

Chaining episodes bears a striking resemblance to the use of options in hierarchical RL ([Botvinick et al., 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R11)). Options are policies that have specific initiation and termination conditions; when one option terminates, another option is invoked. Just as options allow an agent to build reusable subroutines out of primitive actions, episodes allow an agent to reuse past experience. In fact, episodic retrieval may be one way in which options are created.

The second problem—generalization—can be addressed by allowing values to be smooth interpolations of episodes. Specifically, the expected return of a trajectory can be estimated by:

$<math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M5" display="block" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>π</mi></msub><mrow><mo>[</mo><mstyle displaystyle="true"><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></munderover><mrow><msup><mi>γ</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>|</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow></mstyle><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>≈</mo><mfrac><mstyle displaystyle="true"><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>M</mi></msubsup><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mi>K</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mstyle><mstyle displaystyle="true"><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>M</mi></msubsup><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mstyle></mfrac></math>$

where *M* is the number of retrieved memory traces, *sm*1 is the initial state of the trajectory stored in memory trace *m*, and *Rm* is the return for the trajectory. The “kernel function” *K*(*s*1, *sm*1) measures the similarity between the current and retrieved state. The kernel function can also be defined over state-action or state-action-reward tuples. Such generalization is important for the purposes of choice, because it allows an agent to estimate the value of taking a particular action in novel circumstances or in continuous state spaces. Again, an important feature of this model is that the kernel function *K* need not be fixed at the time of initial learning, but can be shaped by subsequent experience, before the episodes are used to guide choice. This contrasts with traditional generalization based on parametric function approximation schemes like neural networks, which amount to averaging values over some area of the state space at encoding time (e.g., [Sutton & Barto, 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R125)).

The appropriate kernel depends on the structure of the state space. For example, in a smooth, real-valued state space, a commonly used kernel is the Gaussian:

where the bandwidth parameter *σ*2 governs the smoothness of the value function approximation; a smaller bandwidth induces sharper generalization gradients, and in the limit produces no generalization (i.e., a pure episodic memory). The optimal bandwidth decreases with the number and increases with dispersion of episodes ([Wasserman, 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R132)). Intuitively, the bandwidth provides a form of regularization, preventing the kernel estimate from overgeneralizing. Kernels can also be defined over discrete state spaces, as well as structured objects like graphs, grammars and trees ([Gärtner et al., 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R43)), and an analogous parameterization of bandwidth can sometimes be specified.

Kernel-based approaches to RL fit snugly with similar approaches applied to other areas of cognition ([Jäkel et al., 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R62)). Exemplar models of memory, categorization, object recognition and function learning can be interpreted as forms of kernel density estimation. Of particular relevance is [Gilboa & Schmeidler’s (2001)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R48) case-based decision theory, which (as we discuss later) applies kernel density estimation to decision problems. Work in machine learning has demonstrated the efficacy of kernel-based approaches ([Ormoneit & Sen, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R92)), though relatively little work has compared the computational and statistical trade-offs of these approaches with conventional model-based and model-free RL.

### RL and memory for individual episodes

The framework outlined above, and the predecessor proposal by [Lengyel and Dayan (2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R75) suggest that RL behavior should, in some circumstances, be driven by memory for individual episodes, distinct from the aggregate statistics of these episodes as would be employed by a model-based or model-free learner. The empirical literature directly supporting these predictions is, at present, fairly sparse, mostly because the sorts of behavioral tasks so far mostly used in RL do not easily lend themselves to addressing these questions. Two limitations of the tasks contribute to this.

First, unlike studies of categorization – where subjects render judgments about many unique stimuli, and exemplar-based models reminiscent of our framework have long been contenders ([Nosofsky, 1986](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R89)) – most laboratory studies of RL consist of many repetitions of essentially identical trials. This means that there has so far been little, experimentally or psychologically, to differentiate episodes, and few objectively predictable features other than temporal recency to govern which episodes subjects might retrieve. Second, although some of the most interesting features of nonparametric episodic evaluation (like RL evaluation in general) play out in the evaluation of sequential decision tasks, existing work relevant to these ideas has mostly taken place in repeated choice-reward “bandit” tasks without sequential structure. However, some supporting evidence does exist.

Recently, [Collins & Frank (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R19) proposed a model and associated experimental task that argued that many trial-by-trial choices in RL tasks in humans were driven by a small set of memories of previous events, held in working memory, rather than incremental running averages of the sort associated with model-free (and model-based) RL. This idea bears some resemblance to the current episodic RL proposal (though focusing on a different memory system for the store). In support of it, they found that increasing the number of stimuli (the set size) or time delays between state visits in a bandit-like task slowed learning, a finding inconsistent with standard RL models but well explained by a model that uses a limited memory buffer over stimulus history to determine action values. Individuals with a genetic polymorphism associated with higher levels of prefrontal dopamine (COMT) exhibited greater retention of previous stimulus history in the action values. Further work using this task has shown that schizophrenic patients have a selective impairment in the working memory component of RL ([Collins et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R18)), consistent with the observation of reduced prefrontal dopamine levels in schizophrenia.

This mechanism does not fully coincide with episodic evaluation as we have described it; first, the task is deterministic and the state space discrete, so aspects of generalization and averaging over noisy outcomes are not exercised. Also, we (and other theorists, like [Zilli & Hasselmo, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R135)), have assumed that for an episode-based RL system to be useful over longer delays (including retaining learning from, say, one day to the next) and larger state spaces, it is likely to involve the episodic memory system of the hippocampus rather than short term working memory.

Another line of work on bandit tasks, in this case with stochastic outcomes, has been carried out by Erev and colleagues (e.g., [Erev et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R36)). These investigators have argued that many aggregate features of subjects’ choice preferences are best explained by a model that maintains individual trial outcomes rather than running averages. According to the model, which can be thought of as an instance of episodic RL, subjects evaluate bandits on the basis of a small sample (e.g., 1 or 2) of particular rewards previously received from them, but not always (as would be predicted by running averages) the most recent ones. The statistics of decision variables implied by such sampling explain a variety of features of preferences in these tasks, such as sensitivity to risk and loss.

One issue standing in the way of examining this sort of model is the basic similarity of all trials to one another in a bandit task. Recent work has integrated incidental trial-unique images with bandit tasks to begin to get leverage on individual episodes. [Bornstein et al. (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R10) found that using these images to remind subjects of previous trials influenced their subsequent action immediately after the reminder: if a past action resulted in a reward, then a reminder of that trial induced subjects to repeat it, whereas if the action resulted in a loss, then a reminder induced subjects to avoid it. This manipulation might be understood as influencing memory retrieval in episodic RL.

[Wimmer et al. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R133) investigated a similar manipulation using fMRI. Here, episodic memory for the trial-unique objects (tested after the experiment) covaried negatively with the influence of reward history on decisions at encoding time, such that better (subsequently measured) episodic memory was associated with weaker feedback-driven learning. This negative effect of successful episodic encoding was also associated with an attenuated striatal prediction error signal and increased connectivity between the hippocampus and the striatum. One possible interpretation of this result in terms of episodic RL is that because the trial-unique objects were entirely incidental to the task, episodic evaluation mechanisms (to the extent that they were engaged) effectively injected uncontrolled noise into the evaluation process, obscuring both reward-driven choice behavior and associated striatal signals.

### Overcoming state aliasing

One advantage of episodic RL already mentioned is its robustness: state values can be validly estimated by remembered trajectories even when the Markov properties do not hold within the trajectory. That is, a set of returns following some current state *s*1 validly estimate its long-term value, even if there are arbitrary long-range dependencies across the events within the sample trajectories. However, this property only partly solves the problems of state representation. In particular, if the starting state *s*1 does not itself satisfy the Markov property (that is, if outcomes following *s*1 depend on events that happened prior to *s*1 but aren’t reflected in it), then the set of returns matching *s*1 will not reflect this additional information. This will introduce additional noise in even episodic value estimates.

Violations of this assumption can occur when states are *aliased*: if multiple states are indistinguishable on the basis of the current observation, then the value is not conditionally independent of the agent’s history given the current observation. Work on this problem again looks to memory (in this case, short term working memory) to disambiguate the state, by augmenting it with appropriate recent stimulus history. For example, if you received instructions to turn left after the second traffic light, the value of a left turn is not specified simply by whether you are at a traffic light, but by the trajectory preceding it. This dependence is eliminated, though, if you can just remember how many traffic lights you passed. In other words, the number of traffic lights is a sufficient statistic for your history, and storing it in memory allows you to incorporate it into the state representation and validly apply standard RL algorithms. The main problem here is how much, and what sort of history to store.

This insight is the basis of several computational models of how working memory aids RL. It has long been recognized that dopamine functions as a “gating” signal in the prefrontal cortex, whereby phasic bursts of dopamine transiently increase the gain of prefrontal neurons, making them more responsive to afferent input ([Cohen, Braver & Brown, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R16)). Importantly, [Braver and Cohen (2000)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R12) demonstrated that TD learning could be used to adaptively gate relevant information into working memory, excluding irrelevant distractors. In essence, this work treated the evaluation (via RL) and selection of “cognitive” actions (inserting and removing items from working memory) in the same way as the selection of motor actions, providing an integrative explanation of dopamine’s role in both cognitive and motor control. [O’Reilly & Frank (2006)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R91) extended this idea by showing how adaptive gating could be realized in a biologically detailed model of prefrontal-basal ganglia interactions. Further insight was provided by Todd, Niv & Cohen (2008), who articulated how adaptive gating could be understood as a normative computational solution to partial observability.

The challenge that all these models address is discovering which particular past events need to be retained in working memory, and for how long. It is noteworthy that Todd et al.’s (2008) model leverages TD(1) value estimation – which is statistically related to the evaluation of state values by episodic sample trajectories ([Sutton & Barto, 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R125)) – to discover these long-run relationships. This suggests that episodic memory might also be useful for the same purpose. From the perspective of an episodic RL model, learning of this sort, in effect, allows the organism to figure out in what circumstances to apply the Markov property. This understanding can then be applied, going forward, to computing values using the experience stored in episodic traces. In keeping with a theme now heard repeatedly, one advantage of this, relative to state learning models such as Todd et al.’s (2008), is that action values need not be relearned from new experience – only recomputed – as the understanding of the state space evolves.

### Approximating value functions over complex state spaces

As discussed earlier, raw memory traces are of limited usefulness when making decisions in novel situations, since they generalize poorly. To use a previous example, exactly counting the number of traffic lights will fail if one is forced to take a detour; in this case, it is necessary to use a value function approximation that degrades gracefully with deviations from the stored memory traces. This limitation motivated the use of kernel methods that allow some degree of generalization.

In RL, this problem is typically addressed as a question of value function approximation: how does an agent approximate the function *V*(*s*) over (potentially continuous and high dimensional) states. Much work in computational neuroscience has gone towards trying to understand how these issues play out in the brain. Proposed architectures typically implement linear or non-linear parametric approximations, e.g. taking *V*(*s*) to be approximated by a weighted sum of a set of basis functions defined over the state space. However, it is unclear whether such parametric approximations can scale up to real-world problems, where the appropriate feature space is elusive. One approach pursued in machine learning has been to develop complex architectures like deep neural networks which can learn to discover good parametric representations from a large amount of training data ([Mnih et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R83)). However, this approach does not seem to provide a complete account of human performance, which can in certain cases be effective after observing a very small amount of data (see below). This ability is partially attributable to strong inductive biases that guide learning ([Griffiths et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R53)). Another factor may be the brain’s use of kernel methods that generalize from sparse training examples to new testing situations, in a way that captures the underlying structure of the state space.

Intuitively, a good kernel assigns high “similarity” to states that have similar values, allowing the value function approximation to average across the rewards in these states while abstaining from averaging over states with different values. In the literature on biological reinforcement learning, these issues of generalization have mainly been discussed in terms of selecting an appropriate set of basis functions for parametric (linear) value function approximation (e.g., [Foster et al., 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R39); [Ludvig et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R79)), but exactly the same considerations apply to the choice of kernel for nonparametric generalization. A particular advantage of the latter is that the kernel is used at choice time rather than encoding time, so it can be learned or adapted by subsequent experience, as in many of the schemes below.

In spatial domains, appropriate generalization can be given a concrete, geometric interpretation. For example, a Gaussian kernel defined over Euclidean spatial coordinates would incorrectly predict that standing outside a bank vault is highly valuable. This mistake is the result of failing to encode the fact that getting inside the vault has very low probability. Geometric boundaries induce discontinuities in an otherwise smooth value function, and such discontinuities can be encoded by representing similarity in terms of *geodesic* distance (the shortest path along the connectivity graph of the space). This principle extends beyond physical space to arbitrary feature spaces ([Tenenbaum et al., 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R126); [Mahadevan, 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R82)).

[Gustafson and Daw (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R54) suggested that place cells in the hippocampus (there conceived as basis functions rather than approximation kernels) encode a geodesic spatial metric, as evidenced by systematic spatial distortions in geometrically irregular environments. This idea was extended by [Stachenfeld et al. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R119), who argued that a geodesic spatial metric in the hippocampus might arise from a more general predictive representation known as the *successor representation* (SR; [Dayan, 1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R28)). In particular, each state (e.g., spatial location) can be represented in terms of the expected future occupancy of successor states. This agrees with geodesic distance in the sense that passing through boundaries is very unlikely and hence the expected future occupancy is low ([Figure 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/figure/F2/)). The SR goes beyond geodesic distance by also incorporating spatial distortions induced by changes in behavioral policy. A key computational virtue of the SR is that it renders value computation trivial: the value of a state is simply the sum of expected future occupancies for each successor state weighted by the expected reward in that state.

**Comparison of the successor representation in different environments**

Each graph shows the successor representation for the state indicated by the green triangle. The rewarded state is indicated by a red cross. (Left) An open field. (Right) Field with a barrier, indicated by the blue line. The top row shows the successor representation for an undirected or “random” walk induced by a policy that moves through the state space randomly. The bottom row shows the results for a directed policy that moves deterministically along the shortest path to the reward.

Instead of a basis function for encoding a parametric value approximation, one can also think of the SR (or the geodesic distance function) as a particular choice of kernel that encodes the underlying structure of the state space. The Bellman equation implies that states and their successors will tend to have similar values, and thus the SR is a good kernel precisely because it is predictive. The SR can be learned directly from state transitions using TD methods ([Dayan, 1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R28); [Stachenfeld et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R119)), and therefore provides a plausible mechanism for adapting the kernel function, with learning, to arbitrary state spaces.

Another aspect of kernel design pertains to multidimensional state spaces: In many real-world tasks, only some of the dimensions are relevant for task performance, necessitating some form of selective attention applied to the feature space. In the kernel view, selective attention would manifest as a distortion of the similarity structure between states depending on the task at hand. This idea has been embodied in several influential exemplar models of categorization, which posit that error-driven learning shapes the mapping from feature inputs to similarity ([Kruschke, 1992](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R70); [Love et al., 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R77)). Recently, related ideas have begun to be explored in RL tasks ([Gershman et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R45); [Niv et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R88); [Vaidya & Fellows, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R130)). This research has shown that classical attention areas in parietal and prefrontal cortex are involved in credit assignment to stimulus features on the basis of reward history. While the researchers offered an account of this phenomenon in terms of model-free RL, it is possible that the same attentional filter impinges on the kernel used by episodic RL. Again, this would be advantageous because applying the attentional filter at choice time, rather than encoding time, reduces the need for relearning values once appropriate dimensional attention is discovered.

### Learning with sparse data

Another advantage of various sorts of episodic estimation is that they can succeed (relatively speaking) in the extreme low-data limit when model-based and model-free learning fail, as demonstrated in simulations by [Lengyel & Dayan (2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R75). This analysis is consistent with evidence for a shift in behavioral control from the hippocampus to the striatum over the course of training in a variety of tasks ([Packard & McGaugh, 1996](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R95); [Poldrack et al., 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R100)), although these tasks do not specifically isolate an episodic RL strategy.

Some suggestive recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus plays a special role in one-shot learning in decision tasks. Lee et al. (2015) found that humans could learn a novel stimulus-reward outcome after a single observation, and this rapid learning selectively recruited the hippocampus. Rapid learning was also associated with increased coupling between the hippocampus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, interpreted in terms of an earlier idea that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex acts as a meta-controller arbitrating between different RL systems ([Lee et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R74)).

The statistically-minded reader may object here that nonparametric approximations like kernel density estimation are typically *less* data-efficient than parametric methods, which is paradoxical in light of our claim that such approximations may be utilized in the low-data limit. It is true that strong parametric assumptions (like the Markovian assumption) can offer an inductive bias to guide and discipline inference, but only a useful one to the extent they are correct. Given the twin problems of high dimensionality and state aliasing in the natural environment, it may well be that standard parametric assumptions can only be relied upon if they are validated and tuned by an initial learning phase that identifies relevant dimensions and stimulus history. Furthermore, while the convergence rate of nonparametric approximations is indeed typically slower, they also achieve an asymptotically lower error because of their superior flexibility ([Wasserman, 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R132)). All this is an example of the bias-variance trade-off ([Geman et al., 1992](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R44)), where nonparametric methods more closely approximate the value function (lower bias) at the expense of poorer generalization (higher variance). The purpose of kernel smoothing is precisely to reduce variance by introducing bias (i.e., regularization). If the value function is itself smooth, and this smoothness is well matched to the kernel function, the added bias will be small; as discussed above, kernel smoothing should be strongest across states with similar expected values, a point that can be made precise using the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces ([Schölkopf & Smola, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R107)). From this discussion, we can posit that episodic RL should perform relatively well in the low-data limit when the value function cannot be well approximated by a parametric family but the values are nonetheless smooth over the state space in a way that is captured by the kernel.

## Interactions between learning systems

A central theme in contemporary research on RL is the interplay between multiple learning and control systems ([Daw et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R25); [Dolan & Dayan, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R32)). Much of this research has focused on the principles guiding competitive interactions between model-free and model-based systems – for instance, under what circumstances is it worth engaging in model-based deliberation vs. simply acting according to previously learned model-free preferences ([Daw et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R25); [Keramati et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R68)) – but the full story is more complex and unsettled, particularly in light of the suggested involvement of episodic memory. First, the possibility of additional influences extends the arbitration questions – when should the brain consult episodes vs. plan using a previously learned map or model? Which episodes? Second, the influences may interact in ways other than simple competition. For instance, as discussed below, in addition to being used to compute values at decision time, episodes may also be useful for off-line training of model-free values, e.g. during sleep. Third, and relatedly, all of these considerations may complicate or confound the working of the model-free and model-based systems as they have previously been conceived. In particular, the cognitive and computational bases for putatively model-based choice are as yet underdetermined, and at least some of what has been taken as model-based behavior may arise from some of these episodic influences.

As we have made clear, episodic RL may well constitute yet another system alongside (or as part of) model-based and model-free. Indeed, in previous research, influences of individual episodes on choice may have been mistaken for either model-free or model-based learning, which are typically assumed to instead depend on statistical summaries learned over many episodes. For instance, in one-step “bandit” choice tasks, memory for individual recent episodes can support trial-by-trial choice adjustment that appears similar to model-free incremental learning of action values ([Erev et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R36); [Collins and Frank, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R19); [Bornstein et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R10)).

Episodic influences may also, in a number of ways, have masqueraded as model-based. In multistep sequential tasks, episodic snapshots of individual trajectories also contain information about the sequential state-state “map” of the task, and may support behavior that has the signatures of map- or model-based choice ([Tolman, 1948](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R128); [Daw et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R24)) without actual use of a statistical world model (e.g., [Gershman et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R46)). Indeed, the idea that planning by mental simulation is supported by episodic rather than (or in addition to) semantic representations is a prominent proposal in the cognitive neuroscience of hippocampal function ([Schacter et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R106); [Hassabis & McGuire, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R57)).

As we have already described, episodic and model-free RL also appear to compete with each other, much like model-based and model-free are thought to. Such competition might be understood as a third system, or an episodic aspect to the model-based system. Successful episodic memory on individual trials is negatively correlated with sensitivity to reward history and neural prediction error signals ([Wimmer et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R133); but see [Murty et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R85) for contrasting results). Interfering effects of episodic memory on reward-guided choice can also be directly induced by adding incidental reminders of past actions ([Bornstein et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R10)). More generally, hippocampal involvement in behavioral control tends to predominate early in training, while striatal involvement predominates later in training ([Packard & McGaugh, 1996](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R95); [Poldrack et al., 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R100)).

These competitive interactions fit with the picture of largely independent systems vying for behavioral control, with a meta-controller arbitrating between the three (or two) systems according to their relative efficacy at different points during training. In particular, episodic RL may be primarily useful early in training when parametric value approximations break down due to the sparsity of data and complexity of the state space ([Lengyel & Dayan, 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R75)). In all these respects, episodic RL as we have envisioned it echoes features that have also been attributed to model-based RL. Though it seems unlikely that episodic RL alone can account for all of the manifestations of model-based RL, it is also clear that these two putative systems so far have not been clearly teased apart in the way that they (collectively) have been dissociated from model-free learning. Doing so will require more precise identification of influences on behavior and brain activity that are verifiably tied to the retrieval of individual episodes, vs. statistical summaries of them as in a map or world model. To the extent this turns out to be true, it also will suggest fleshing out the emerging theoretical and experimental account of competition between model-based and model-free influences – broadly speaking, thought to reflect rational speed-accuracy tradeoffs about the usefulness of recomputing action values (Keramati et al., 2010) – to also weigh the relative costs and benefits of consulting raw episodes for these recomputations, vs. a summary model.

The influences of episodic memory may also crosscut the model-based and model-free distinction, complicating the picture still further. For instance, the striatum and hippocampus may interact cooperatively as well as competitively (for a review, see [Pennartz et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R97)). Evidence suggests that replay of memories ([Lansink et al., 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R72)) and oscillatory dynamics ([van der Meer & Redish, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R131)) in the two regions are coordinated. Human neuroimaging studies have demonstrated functional connectivity between hippocampus and striatum during virtual navigation ([Brown et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R14)) and context-dependent decision making ([Ross et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R104)).

One functional explanation for some of these interactions is that they support synergistic influences of episodic memory on model-free values. Such interactions would further leverage episodic memory for choice (beyond the nonparametric value computation discussed thus far) and also produce choices that again might appear to mimic some of the behaviors of a model-based system. Model-free RL is, in its traditional conception, limited to learning from direct experience, which renders it inflexible. For example, separately experiencing different parts of an environment will result in a disjointed model-free value function, where the consistency of values implied by the Bellman equation is violated at the part boundaries. One of the traditional signatures of a model-based system is the ability to “stitch” these parts together by using them to build a world model that can then be used to simulate sequences of state transitions and rewards that were never experienced together ([Shohamy and Daw, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R111)). However, another way to achieve the same effect is to feed such ersatz experience to a model-free learner, which can then use it like actual experience it to update its stored values. This can actually be achieved without even building a world model, by simply replaying snippets of experience from episodic memory, interleaved across the otherwise separate experiences. Such a replay mechanism is another way (other than nonparametric evaluation) in which episodic memories might influence choice, by driving model-free value learning. This hybrid architecture was originally proposed in the machine learning literature by [Sutton (1991)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R124), who referred to it as *Dyna.*

[Gershman and colleagues (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R46) reported behavioral evidence that valuation in humans is supported by Dyna-like offline replay. In these experiments, people separately learned different parts of a single MDP and then were given a retrospective revaluation test to see if their decisions reflected an integrated value. The experiment indeed found evidence for revaluation, which has typically been taken as a signature of model-based value computation. However, the experiments showed that the extent of successful revaluation was sensitive to several manipulations designed to affect Dyna-style offline replay, but which would be irrelevant to model-based choice (in the sense of “just in time” computation of decision variables by mental simulation at choice time). In particular, revaluation was disrupted by placing people under cognitive load *during the learning* rather than the subsequent choice phase, using a secondary task. The deleterious effects of load could be mitigated simply by giving people a brief period of quiescence (listening to classical music) before the revaluation test, consistent with the operation of an offline simulation process.

Recent neuroimaging studies ([Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R134); [Kurth-Nelson et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R71)) also demonstrate that successful revaluation in a similar integration task is supported by memories retrieved at learning (rather than choice) time. More generally (though without being linked to decisions or learning), replay of the neural responses to previous experiences has repeatedly been observed in neuronal recordings from hippocampus, during quiet rest, sleep, and even ongoing behavior ([Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R116); [Carr et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R15)). These phenomena provide a suggestive candidate for a neural substrate for replay-based learning. However, in all these cases, including the human experiments, it is not yet wholly clear whether the memories being retrieved are episodic (e.g., in the sense of autobiographical snapshots of individualized events), vs. reflecting more semantic knowledge derived from the statistics of multiple episodes, like a statistical world model.

## Relationship to other frameworks

### Case-based decision theory and decision by sampling

Work in behavioral economics has explored the role of memory in decision making, focusing on one-shot decision problems rather than the sequential problems on which we have focused. The starting point of this work is a critique of expected utility theory, the cornerstone of neoclassical economics, which assumes that a decision maker will consider all possible states of the world and all possible outcomes, so as to average over these in computing expected value. As pointed out by [Gilboa & Schmeidler (2001)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R48), many real-world situations poorly fit the expected utility framework: the set of states and set of outcomes are not readily available to the decision maker. For example, the choice of a nanny would require the enumeration of all possible nanny profiles and all possible consequences of hiring a particular nanny. These sets are, for all practical purposes, infinite. To address this problem, Gilboa & Schmeidler developed a “case-based” decision theory (CBDT), drawing upon a venerable tradition in cognitive science ([Riesbeck & Schank, 1989](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R103)).

A basic primitive of this theory is the case, consisting of a decision problem, an act, and an outcome. Previously observed cases constitute memories. The decision maker is endowed with a similarity function on decision problems and a utility function on outcomes, and is assumed to rank acts for a new decision problem by comparing it to previous cases using the similarity function. This formulation does not require the exhaustive enumeration of states and outcomes, only the retrieval of a subset from memory. Interestingly, the ranking mechanism is precisely a form of kernel-based value estimation, with the similarity function corresponding to a kernel and the cases corresponding to episodes.

The similarity function posited by CBDT effectively determines what memories are available. For simplicity, we can imagine that the similarity is 0 for some memories, so that these memories are not retrieved into the available subset, and a constant value for all the retrieved memories. In the most basic form of CBDT, the utility assigned to an act is then proportional to the summed utilities of outcomes stored in the subset of retrieved memories for which a was chosen. This model has interesting implications for the role played by memory in determining reference points, since acts will only be judged with respect to available memories ([Simonson, & Tversky, 1992](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R114)). For example, [Simonsohn and Loewenstein (2006)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R115) reported that a household moving to a new city will exhibit dramatically different spending on rent depending on the distribution of rents in their city of origin. In related theoretical work, [Bordalo et al. (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R9) formulated a memory-based model of decision making that allows retrieved memories to influence the decision maker’s reference points.

[Stewart et al. (2006)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R122) took this logic a step further in their “decision by sampling” theory by arguing that all decision-theoretic quantities (utility, probability, temporal duration, etc.) are based on samples from memory. They demonstrated that the descriptive parameterization of these quantities in Prospect Theory ([Kahneman & Tversky, 1979](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R65)) can be empirically derived from their ecological distribution (a proxy for their availability in memory). For example, Stewart et al. found that the distribution of credits to bank accounts (a measure of the ecological distribution of gains) is approximately power-law distributed, implying a power-law revealed utility function under the assumption that the utility function reflects the relative rank of gains. This analysis reproduces the curvature of the utility function proposed by [Kahneman and Tversky (1979)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R65) on purely descriptive grounds to explain risk aversion, while analogous considerations about the relative distribution of debits explain loss aversion.

The idea that subjective utility is computed relative to a memory-based sample has profound implications for models of decision making. It suggests that there is no stable valuation mechanism that consistently obeys the axioms of rational choice. This idea is grounded in a set of psychological principles that extend far beyond economic decisions. Essentially all judgments, ranging from the psychophysics of magnitude, duration and pain to causal reasoning and person perception, are relative: the same object can be perceived as dramatically different depending on contextual factors that determine a comparison set ([Kahneman & Miller, 1986](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R64); [Stewart et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R121)). This point has not been lost on marketing researchers, who have long recognized the importance of comparison (or “consideration”) set composition in consumer choice ([Bettman, 1979](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R7); [Lynch & Srull, 1982](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R80); [Nedundgadi, 1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R86)).

### Contingent sampling models and instance-based learning

While most economic models have been developed to explain “decisions from description” (e.g., explicitly described lotteries), RL paradigms typically involve “decisions from experience” (where the lottery structure must be learned). Behavioral economists have also studied experiential learning in bandit-like problems, in a largely separate literature from the study of RL. The key finding stressed here is that experiential learning often produces striking divergences from description-based decisions ([Hertwig & Erev, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R59)). For example, the classic description-based experiments of [Kahneman and Tversky (1979)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R65) demonstrated apparent overweighting of rare events, but experience-based experiments have found the opposite phenomenon: underweighting of rare events (e.g., [Barron & Erev, 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R3); [Hau et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R58)). As already discussed, Erev and colleagues have argued that this underweighting is the result of contingent sampling from memory, where “contingent” refers to the fact that samples are drawn based on similarity to the current situation. Because rare events are less likely to appear in the sampled set, these events will be relatively neglected. This model can also explain a number of other puzzling behaviors, such as overconfidence (due to a biased estimate of variance from small samples; Dougherty et al., 1999) and inertia (tendency to repeat previous choices; [Biele et al., 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R8)). Closely related “instance-based learning” models have been developed by Gonzalez and colleagues ([Gonzalez et al., 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R52); [Gonzalez & Dutt, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R51)). The important point for the present discussion is that the samples themselves resemble episodes, and the sampling process itself effectively implements a form of kernel smoothing, and hence fits into our general framework.

If decisions from experience depend on some form of contingent sampling, then we should expect that memory biases will influence decisions. Ludvig, Madan and colleagues have shown that the bias to recall extremely positive or negative events is systematically related to risk preferences. In one set of experiments ([Madan et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R81)), individual differences in the tendency to recall extreme events was positively correlated with preference for risky gains and negatively correlated with preference for risky losses. Another experiment ([Ludvig et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R78)) manipulated memory using a priming cue, and showed that priming past wins promotes risk seeking. On the theoretical side, [Lieder et al. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953519/#R76) have shown how a sampling strategy that overweights extreme events is rational when the goal is to minimize the variance of the expected utility estimate from a limited number of samples.

## Conclusions

We have reviewed the current cognitive neuroscience picture of RL, in which model-based and model-free systems compete (and sometimes cooperate) for control of behavior. This dual-system architecture is motivated computationally by the need to balance speed and flexibility, but we have argued that neither system (at least as traditionally conceived) is designed to perform well in high-dimensional, continuous and partially observable state spaces when data are sparse and observations have dependencies over long temporal distances. Unhappily, this situation may be characteristic of many real-world learning problems. A third system—episodic RL—may offer a partial solution to these problems by implementing a form of nonparametric value function approximation. As we have shown, this notion can tie together many disparate observations about the role of episodic memory in RL. Nonetheless, our theory is still largely speculative. We framed it abstractly in order to highlight the generality of the ideas, but to make progress the theory must first be more precisely formalized so that it can make quantitative predictions. We expect this to be an exciting frontier for research, both theoretical and experimental, in the near future.
