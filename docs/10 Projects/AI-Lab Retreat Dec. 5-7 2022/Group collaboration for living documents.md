# A New Publication Method for a Future of Shared Knowledge
# Statement
This project seeks to address an issue of accessibility and obtainability of information, both in relation to internal and external parties, creators and audience.

This methodology seeks to create solutions for both creators and audience by offering a standardization and accessibly archiving wells of knowledge and ideas. However, this last sentence was poorly phrased so let me unroll my explanation.

As we work now, research is done not in a collective manner. Instead, this team is a group of individuals working on individual projects regardless of overlap or divergence from each other. Any collaborative enterprises taken by team members are arranged on a individual basis, where the integration of any work between two or more team members is likewise a bespoke arrangement, with no common standard or availability to other team members.

To reiterate, as we work now, we create individual solutions and materials for our research that is mostly non-commutable to others in our lab. Most of our work, whether that be reading, writing, or analysis stays on our own individual computers

This observation, does not oversimplify or overlook the fact that each member of the lab may have unique methods of research and production that can be easily reduced.

What we seek is to instead create a low-friction method to easily share and archive our knowledge in a common repository, which not only captures information
