# INTRODUCTION 

? 

## 1.1 About the client 

Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, two childhood friends who shared a passion for computer programming, their first major product being the BASIC programming language, which they developed for the Altair 8800 computer. 

In the early 1980s, Microsoft began to focus on operating systems for personal computers, and they released their first version of Microsoft Windows in 1985. Windows quickly became the dominant operating system for PCs, and Microsoft launched a number of successful software products, including Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, and the Xbox game console. 

Throughout the 1990s-2000s, Microsoft faced a number of antitrust lawsuits and regulatory challenges, but the company continued to grow and diversify. In 2000, Bill Gates resigned as CEO and was replaced by Steve Ballmer, who led the company through a period of significant expansion. 

Under Ballmer's leadership, Microsoft acquired a number of major companies, including LinkedIn, Skype, and Nokia's telephone business. The company also shifted its focus to cloud computing and subscription-based services, launching Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. 

In 2014, Satya Nadella became CEO of Microsoft and has since continued to focus on cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Under Nadella's leadership, Microsoft has become one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. 

Microsoft Norway is part of Microsoft Corporation, where it is responsible for providing technology solutions, services, and products to customers in Norway, as well as supporting customers and partners in Norway. The partner network consists of companies that partner with Microsoft to deliver technology solutions and services to customers in Norway. This network is an important part of Microsoft's business model, and the company works closely with its partners to ensure that customers receive the best solutions and support. 

## 1.2 Research question 

The plan is to optimize Microsoft Omnichannel and integrate it into Dynamics 365. Microsoft Omnichannel is a software solution from Microsoft that provides businesses with a unified platform to deliver customer service across all communication channels and devices. This means that customers can contact a business via a variety of channels, such as phone, email, chat, social media or mobile app, and still get a unified and seamless customer experience. 

Omnichannel does this by integrating customer interactions from all of these channels into a common platform, so that customer service representatives have a unified view of customer interactions. This enables representatives to deliver a more efficient and cohesive customer experience, regardless of communication channel. 

The software solution also includes automation of customer service processes, allowing companies to handle high volumes of inquiries while maintaining a high quality of customer service. Microsoft Omnichannel also supports analytics and reporting, so businesses can track performance and identify areas for improvement. 

In general, this tool can help companies enhance the customer experience, increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as improve the efficiency and productivity of their customer service process. 

Dynamics 365 is a cloud-based suite of applications for enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management that is offered by Microsoft. It provides a variety of integrated customer engagement and HR. It contains various applications that can be purchased individually or together. These applications include: 

1. Finance: A financial management solution that helps businesses manage their finances and simplify financial processes. 

2. Supply Chain Management: A solution that helps businesses manage inventory, logistics, and simplify financial processes. 

3. Sales: A sales automation solution that helps businesses manage sales processes, customer interactions, and lead generation. 

4. Customer Service: A solution that helps businesses manage their customer service operations and provide a better customer experience. 

5. Field Service: A solution that helps businesses manage field service operations, including scheduling dispatch and inventory management. 

6. Human resources: An HR sewing solution that helps businesses manage their workforce and HR operations 

7. Marketing: Helps businesses create and manage marketing campaigns, generate leads, and measure campaign performance. 

### AI and machine learning: 

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two rapidly growing fields of data science that are revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes using machines, while ML is part of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and static models that enable computers to learn from data and make decisions or make predictions without being explicitly programmed.  

AI systems can be broadly categorized into two types: rule-based systems and machine learning systems. Rule-based systems use a variety of predefined rules and logic to make decisions, while machine learning systems use algorithms and static models to automatically identify patterns in data and learn from them. 

ML algorithms can be further categorized into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct answers are known, to make predictions on new, unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings. Reinforcement learning involves training a model through trial and error, where the model receives feedback based on its actions and adjusts the behavior accordingly. 

ML is used in a variety of applications, from image recognition and speech recognition to natural language processing and recommendation systems. For example, face recognition technology uses ML algorithms to identify faces in photos or videos, while speech recognition technology uses ML algorithms to convert speech to text. 

While AI and ML offer many benefits, they also raise concerns around the ethical and social implications of automating and decision-making machines. It is important to ensure that these systems are transparent, accountable and designed to promote human values and ethical principles.

# METHOD AND PROCESS 

## 2.1 Choice of development method 

To ensure that the project is completed within the set time frame, it is beneficial to use a recognized development method. Through the subject system development, we reviewed several methods, including waterfall methods and agile methods. The waterfall methods are sharp and involve completing given tasks before moving on to the next part of the process. This makes changes difficult to implement, requires a lot of planning in advance and is best suited for projects with clearly defined goals and requirements.  

### 2.1.1 SCRUM 

SCRUM, on the other hand, is an agile project management method for developing software and other complex projects. It uses iterative and incremental working methods, where the team works for short, fixed periods called "sprints". The team collaborates closely and holds regular meetings to plan, evaluate, and adjust the work. SCRUM is designed to be flexible and adapt to changes in the project. Something that is essential in a project where things are not fixed from the start, and when you have to be open to the framework changing. A sprint lasts anywhere from 1 to 4 weeks, and at the end of each sprint, the team should have produced a working product that can be shown to the customer or product manager.

# THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT 

As the task was carried out using agile development methodology, we chose to set up five SCRUM sprints, as well as one handover sprint.  

ATTACHMENT 

The Gantt chart below visualizes the project's progress, sprints, and milestones. A milestone is an important checkpoint in a project where you can evaluate the process and adjust the plan if necessary(Source). The first milestone was set to illustrate that the project is moving from the planning phase to the development phase. Here it was important to check the planning that had been carried out and that all necessary information was available before the sprint began. The next milestone was set after the second sprint to further plan the course of the project.
