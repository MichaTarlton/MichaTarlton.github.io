## Fixed Interval (FI)
In fixed interval tasks, an animal must respond to a stimulus after a learned interval of time. In this case the trial is initiated with a discriminative stimulus. The first lever press response from the animal, in response to the initiating stimulus, begins the fixed interval time.

 After the FI time from the initial press, another reward is available. The first lever press from the animal following the FI is rewarded with a reinforcement stimulus.
 
The point of this is to study the animal motor or neural behavior during the task, from which we can interpret how the animal internally represents the passage of time.

To make comparative experiments, we repeat the experiment in repeated sequences in what is the *serial fixed interval task* (shown below) as well as for different duration sizes of the fixed interval.

## Serial Fixed Interval  
At the end of each FI trial an exponentially distributed inter-trial interval is added. This reduces the predictability of the next trial.

The FI delay can be static or incrementally increased in duration over the trials. This allows for measurement of behavior in changing conditions to trained expectations.

## Peak Interval (PI)
Peak interval testing is similar to serial fixed interval trials, however several trials, randomly chosen,  do not deliver the reinforcement reward when the animal responds. These are called *peak trials*. The goal being to observe when the onset and tapering of the animalâ€™s expectation of reward. These are longer than the typical FI trial, with a minimum duration of 3 * FI.
