## Abstract

In this study, the authors developed a fundamental theory of interval timing behaviour, inspired by the learning-to-time (LeT) model and the scalar expectancy theory (SET) model, and based on quantitative analyses of such timing behaviour. Our experiments used the peak-interval procedure with rats. The proposed model of timing behaviour comprises *clocks*, a *regulator*, a *mixer*, a *response*, and *memory*. Using our model, we calculated the basic clock speeds indicated by the subjects’ behaviour under such peak procedures. In this model, the scalar property can be defined as a kind of transposition, which can then be measured quantitatively. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) values indicated that the current model fit the data slightly better than did the SET model. Our model may therefore provide a useful addition to SET for the analysis of timing behaviour.

## Introduction

“What is time?” Among the innumerable, difficult problems as yet unsolved by humans, this may be one of the toughest. The ultimate goal of the first author is the mathematical axiomatization of psychological time (subjective time) achieved through an analysis founded on behavioural science. Physicists have long expressed objective time as a real number line. Subsequently, in the last century, objective time was embodied in Minkowski spacetime, a four-dimensional space possessing time as the fourth coordinate, by theorists of relativity. It seems to us, however, that even Zeno’s paradoxes, such as “Achilles and the tortoise” and “the arrow,” are as yet unsettled (Vlastos ([1967](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR35 "Vlastos, G. (1967). Zeno of Elea. In: The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 8. Macmillan, New York, (pp. 369–379).")), Alper and Bridger ([1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR3 "Alper, J.S., & Bridger, M. (1997). Mathematics, models and Zeno’s paradoxes. Synthese, 110, 143–166."))). Some of the important open questions that remain are the following: “What is *subjective time* like?”; “How do organisms perceive *time*?”; and “How are organisms’ perceptions of *time* reflected in their behaviour?” We must collect facts about the characteristics of subjective time before we can identify its underlying mathematical axioms. The present analysis targets identifying such axioms.

### Time perception and interval timing

Perceived time is also called psychological time, and it is distinct from physically measured time. Unlike most perceptions, which are based on the senses, the perception of time is not associated with specific organs or external stimuli that create an organisms’ experiences of time. Nonetheless, not only multicellular organisms but also single-celled organisms, such as paramecia and the true slime mould *Physarum polycephalum*, have time perception (Saigusa et al. [2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR32 "Saigusa, T., Tero, A., Nakagaki, T., Kuramoto, Y. (2008). Amoebae anticipate periodic events. Physical Review Letters, 100(1), 018101.")).

Interval timing is based on time perception. The mechanisms of circadian timing and millisecond timing have been clarified, to some extent. Interval timing, however, differs from circadian timing and millisecond timing in its precision. Interval timing is less precise than either of the other two types of timing: it is accurate only to within a wide seconds-to-minutes-to-hours range, while circadian timing is precise to within a narrow range of around twenty-four hours, and millisecond timing is of a mixed precision that lies within the subsecond range (Buhusi and Meck [2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR5 "Buhusi, C.V., & Meck, W.H. (2005). What makes us tick? Functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 6(10), 755–765.")). Given this difference in precision, it is likely that the mechanism underlying interval timing differs from those underlying these other two forms of timing.

In the current study, fixed interval (FI) schedules of reinforcement were used to study interval timing. With FI schedules, only the first response that occurs after a fixed duration is reinforced. To better study the full course of responding over time, Roberts ([1981](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR31 "Roberts, S. (1981). Isolation of an internal clock. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, 7, 242–268.")) invented the peak-interval (PI) procedure. The PI procedure includes both FI trials and probe trials. In probe trials no reinforcement is provided, and the length of the trial greatly exceeds the length of the intervals used during the FI trials. Interval timing is often investigated through use of the PI procedure (See Fig. [9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig9) for actual data from our experiment, shown as dots; also see Fig. 2 in Church ([1984](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR7 "Church, R.M. (1984). Properties of the internal clock. Annals of The New York Academy of Sciences, 423, 566–582.")); Zentall ([2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR37 "Zentall, T. (2006). Timing, memory for intervals, and memory for untimed stimuli: The role of instructional ambiguity. Behavioural Processes, 71, 88–97."))).[Footnote 1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fn1)

### SET and LeT

Investigations of vertebrates’ sensitivity to time have culminated in many theories. Among them, the scalar expectancy theory (SET) model and the learning-to-time (LeT) model are mathematically interesting.[Footnote 2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fn2)

Gibbon ([1977](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR14 "Gibbon, J. (1977). Scalar expectancy theory and Weber’s law in animal timing. Psychological Review, 84, 279–325.")) and his colleagues developed the SET model of timing (Gibbon [1977](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR14 "Gibbon, J. (1977). Scalar expectancy theory and Weber’s law in animal timing. Psychological Review, 84, 279–325."); Gibbon et al. [1984](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR15 "Gibbon, J., Church, R.M., Meck, W.H (1984). Scalar timing in memory. Annals of The New York Academy of Sciences, 423, 52–77.")). SET is very successful at describing subjective time across many interval lengths. In short, SET provides a cognitive and stochastic account of information processing to explain temporal behaviour in animals. The components of SET are a pacemaker, a switch, an accumulator, memories, and a comparator, and the model proposes that together these components produce instrumental responses (Fig. 1. See also Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig1) in Allman et al. ([2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR2 "Allman, M.J., Teki, S., Griffiths, T.D., Meck, W.H (2014). Properties of the internal clock: First- and second-order principles of subjective time. Annual Review of Psychology, 65, 743–771.")) and its detailed neurological review). The explicit solution of a PI procedure is

$$
R(t)= a\exp \left\{ -\frac{\,1\,}{\,2\,}\left(\frac{\,t-t_{0}\,}{\,b\,}\right)^{2} \right\}+R_{0},
$$

(1)

where *R*(*t*) is the operant response function at time *t*, *t* 0 is the *t*\-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of *R*(*t*), *b* is the standard deviation, and *a* and *R* 0 are parameters. This is a modified version of the density function for the normal distribution.

Properties of the internal clock: First- and second-order principles of subjective time. Annual Review of Psychology, 65, 743–771.")). A pacemaker generates pulses. Pulses are first stored in an accumulator and then stored in the working memory. After reinforcement, the contents of the working memory are transferred to the reference memory. In later trials, previous delay lengths stored in the reference memory are compared with the number in the accumulator, and the ratio of the two numbers determines the subsequent behaviour

Psychological Review, 104, 241–265.")) developed the LeT model of timing, retaining the basic elements of the behavioural theory-of-timing (BeT) model, which was developed by Killeen and Fetterman ([1988](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR18 "Killeen, P.R., & Fetterman, J.G.

Shifts in the psychometric function and their implications for models of timing. Journal of The Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 74, 25–54.")); Killeen and Taylor ([2000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR19 "Killeen, P.R., & Taylor, T.J. (2000).

Psychological Review, 107, 430–459.")).[Footnote 3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fn3) In short, the LeT model is a behavioural and deterministic account of learning formulated to explain temporal behaviour in animals. Its components, which include behavioural states and associative links, produce instrumental responses (Fig. [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig2)). The LeT model therefore describes a dynamical system that individuals use to produce temporal behaviour.

Both SET and LeT inspired the current authors’ ambition to create a new theory of timing behaviour that is both descriptive and interpretive of quantitative analyses in neuroscience. Although this theory is similar to LeT in several ways, we hope that, like SET, it will be successful at describing subjective timing behaviour across a wide range of interval lengths.

## A new model of timing behaviour

Since mathematics is a deductive system, it is convenient to construct a deterministic model of timing behaviour. However, this does not imply that a useful stochastic model of this timing behaviour could not be developed.

### Model of clocks; functions *X* *n* (*t*)

Gibbon et al. ([1984](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR15 "Gibbon, J., Church, R.M., Meck, W.H (1984). Scalar timing in memory. Annals of The New York Academy of Sciences, 423, 52–77.")) incorporated into SET the assumption that an internal “pacemaker” exists. Machado used clocks modelled by a cascade (stream flow) as “behavioural states” in the LeT model (Machado [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR22 "Machado, A. (1997). Learning the temporal dynamics of behavior. Psychological Review, 104, 241–265.")). Our model also assumes the existence of clocks, although we do not yet know how these clocks are related to the organisms’ counting-like behaviours (Meck ([1996](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR27 "Meck, W.H. (1996). Neuropharmacology of timing and time perception. Cognitive Brain Research, 3, 227–242."), [2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR28 "Meck, W.H. (2006).

Stimulus dynamics and temporal discrimination: Implications for pacemakers. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, 35, 525–537."))). We are thus willing to consider models that offer precise accounts of specific types of timing behaviour as well as those that provide more general accounts of a wider range of timing behaviours.

The cascade model used to create our model of timing behaviour is illustrated in Fig. [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig3). This cascade model is simple, and it has much in common with the cascade model that is part of the LeT model. In our model, the containers are aligned vertically, and each container is analogous to a clock. These clocks each provide information to the organism about how much of the interval has elapsed, and the “volume” with which a given clock provides this information is equivalent to the amount of water in the corresponding container.

**Fig. 3**

[![figure 3](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10827-014-0542-4/MediaObjects/10827_2014_542_Fig3_HTML.gif)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4/figures/3)

Snapshots of the cascade model used to illustrate the dynamics of clocks. There is a hole in the *bottom* of each container. At the beginning of a PI trial (represented by the leftmost column in the figure), the *top* container is filled with water, and the other containers are empty. In this figure, the columns from *left* to *right* provide a series of snapshots of the state of the containers as time elapses, and thus the quantity of water in each one changes. The quantity of water in each container may be considered analogous to the amount of influence the associated clock has on the subject’s estimate of the length of the interval being timed that has thus far elapsed

[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4/figures/3)

We use *X* *n* (*t*) to denote the amount of water in the *n*th container (*n* = 0, 1, 2, 3, …), where *t* $(\geqq 0)$ represents the physical time that has elapsed since the onset of the interval being timed. We assume that *X* *n* (*t*) is differentiable at any time *t*, and the value of *X* *n* (*t*) is a nonnegative real number. Let *λ* be a positive constant. Based on Machado ([1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR22 "Machado, A. (1997). Learning the temporal dynamics of behavior. Psychological Review, 104, 241–265.")), we propose the following set of differential equations:

$$
\frac{d}{\,dt\,}X_{n}(t)=\lambda X_{n-1}(t)-\lambda X_{n}(t)\quad(n=1,2,3,\ldots).
$$

(5)

Equation ([4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ4)) is the initial condition of *X* 0(*t*), and it expresses the fact that the top container is filled with water at the beginning (*t* = 0) of each trial. Equation ([4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ2)) is the initial condition of *X* *n* (*t*) (*n* = 1, 2, 3, …), and it expresses the fact that the other containers are empty at *t* = 0. In Eq. ([3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ3)), $\frac {\,d\,}{\,dt\,}X_{0}(t)$ is the first derivative of *X* 0(*t*), and $\frac {\,d\,}{\,dt\,}X_{0}(t)$ can be read as the differential coefficient of *X* 0(*t*) at time *t*, which is the rate of change (decrease, in this case) of *X* *n* (*t*) at time *t*. Thus, Eq. ([3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ3)) expresses the fact that water in the top container flows out of that container at a rate proportional to the amount of water left in the container at that time. The positive constant *λ*, previously defined, is used here as the proportional coefficient in this relation. Take an arbitrary *n* (*n* = 1, 2, 3, …), and hold it fixed. In Eq. ([5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ5)), $\frac {\,d\,}{\,dt\,}X_{n}(t)$ on the left-hand side can be read as the rate of change of *X* *n* (*t*) at time *t*. The term *λ* *X* *n* − 1(*t*) on the right-hand side expresses the fact that the *n*th container receives water at a rate proportional to the amount of water in the (*n* − 1)th container at that time, and the term −*λ* *X* *n* (*t*) on the same side expresses the fact that the *n*th container loses water at a rate proportional to the amount of water in the *n*th container at that time. Inductively, the term *λ* *X* *n* − 1(*t*) may be read as the rate at which the previous (*n* − 1)th container loses water. All the proportional coefficients of the relations described by Eqs. ([2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ2))–([5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ5)) are identical and are equal to the constant *λ*.

As can be proven by mathematical induction on *n*, the solution of Eqs. ([2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ2))–([5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ5)) is the density function of the Poisson distribution, i.e., the gamma density function:

$$
X_{n}(t)=\frac{\,\exp(-\lambda t)\cdot(\lambda t)^{n}\,}{n!}\quad(n=0,1,2,3,\ldots).
$$

(6)

The graph for each *n*(*n* = 0, 1, 2, 3) is presented in Fig. [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig4), using $\frac {1}{\,\lambda \,}=15$ seconds to provide an illustrative example. By differential calculus, we see that *X* *n* (*t*) has its peak at $t=\frac {\,n\,}{\,\lambda \,}$ (*n* = 0, 1, 2, 3, …).

**Fig. 4**

[![figure 4](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10827-014-0542-4/MediaObjects/10827_2014_542_Fig4_HTML.gif)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4/figures/4)

Example of the clocks included in the Poisson decomposition (PD) model. Graphs of *X* *n* (*t*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, 3), plotted with bold lines, show the change in water quantity in the containers after time *t*, the physical time elapsed since the start of the trial. *X* *n* (*t*) has its peak at $t=\frac {\,n\,}{\,\lambda \,}$ (*n* = 0, 1, 2, 3). The peak times in these graphs are examples where $\frac {\,1\,}{\,\lambda \,}$ is arbitrarily set to be 15 (sec)

During each trial, the value of *λ* was determined in some way by the data extracted from *memory*, and after each FI trial ends with reinforcement, the new value of *λ* is stored in *memory*. This process corresponds to what was called “recalibration” by Killeen ([1975](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR17 "Killeen, P.R. (1975). On the temporal control of behavior. Psychological Review, 82, 89–115."); Fetterman and Killeen [1991](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR12 "Fetterman, J.G., & Killeen, P.R. (1991). Adjusting the pacemaker. Learning and Motivation, 22, 226–252.")).

In the present model, we assume that it is necessary to express each instant of time $\frac {\,n\,}{\,\lambda \,}$ (*n* = 0, 1, 2, 3, …) with an accompanying span for both before and after that moment $\frac {\,n\,}{\,\lambda \,}$; note that this spread does *not* indicate an error. This deterministic model differs in this from the stochastic counter model offered by Killeen and Taylor ([2000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR19 "Killeen, P.R., & Taylor, T.J. (2000). How the propagation of error through stochastic counters affects time discrimination and other psychophysical judgments. Psychological Review, 107, 430–459.")), which used the cascade as an explanation of the error.

As is mentioned in Dayan and Abbott ([2001](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR11 "Dayan, P., & Abbott, L.F. (2001). Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press."), p. 34) “even when it successfully describes data, the Poisson model does not provide a mechanistic explanation of neuronal response variability,” that is, it is not necessary to find a cascade structure in biological systems. Figure [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig3) is an abstract example to explan the consecutive reaction, which is widely studied in chemistry. In many applications, the outputs of the model clocks should be replaced by actual output.

### Model of regulator; functions *c* *n* (*s*)*X* *n* (*t*)

*N* denotes the total number of sessions, and *m* + 1 denotes the maximal number of clocks used. Mathematically speaking, in the *s*th session (*s* = 1, 2, 3, …,*N*), for each *n* (*n* = 0, 1, 2, … , *m*), the *regulator* prepares the set of real numbers *c* *n* (*s*); then it calculates the product *c* *n* (*s*)*X* *n* (*t*), amplifying *X* *n* (*t*) by *c* *n* (*s*). In other words, the *regulator* assigns weights to the clocks. We assume that the weights *c* *n* (*s*) are constant within a session. In this regard, the LeT model has the associative strength function *W* *n* (*t*), which varies within a trial,

During each trial, the set of values of *c* *n* (*s*) is determined by the data extracted from *memory*, and after each FI trial ends with reinforcement, the new set of values of *c* *n* (*s*) is stored in *memory*. This process forms an additional component of the “recalibration” process.

### Model of mixer; function *R* *s* (*t*)

We use *R* *s* (*t*) to denote the psychometric function, the source of the operant response, which is produced by the *mixer*, in the *s*th session of a trial.

In our model, we define *R* *s* (*t*) such that

$$
R_{s}(t)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^{m}c_{n}(s)X_{n}(t),
$$

(7)

a linear combination of functions *X* *n* (*t*) with coefficients *c* *n* (*s*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, … , *m*). For a typical example in which $\frac {\,1\,}{\,\lambda \,}=15$ seconds, the length of the trial is 90 seconds, and *m* = 3, this becomes

$$
\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} R_{s}(t) &=&\sum\limits_{n=0}^{3}c_{n}(s)X_{n}(t) \\ &=&c_{0}(s)X_{0}(t) +c_{1}(s)X_{1}(t) \\ &&+c_{2}(s)X_{2}(t) +c_{3}(s)X_{3}(t). \end{array}
$$

(8)

Please note that *c* *n* (*s*) is not limited to positive real numbers. Let us go one step further into metaphor. If *c* *n* (*s*) > 0, then at a given time *t*, the living organism hears its internal *n*th clock claiming, “*It’s time*” (the interval has elapsed), *X* *n* (*t*), amplified by the rate *c* *n* (*s*), taken as an activating motive. If *c* *n* (*s*) < 0, then at a given time *t* the living organism hears its internal *n*th clock claiming, “*It’s not time*,” *X* *n* (*t*), amplified by the rate |*c* *n* (*s*)|(=−*c* *n* (*s*) > 0), taken as an inhibitory motive; and, if *c* *n* (*s*)=0, then the living organism does not hear the *n*th clock. The term *mixer* is used to designate the component of the model involved in this process, which leads to an automatic summation of *c* *n* (*s*)*X* *n* (*t*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, … , *m*).

For any natural number *m*, the functions *X* *n* (*t*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, … , *m*) are linearly independent, which can be shown mathematically. Therefore, for a given *R* *s* (*t*), their linear combination in Eq. ([7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ7)) is unique. At the same time, Eq. ([7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ7)) can be read as a decomposition of *R* *s* (*t*) into independent components *X* *n* (*t*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, … , *m*). Thus, in this study, both our total model and our method of analysis are a Poisson decomposition (PD).[Footnote 4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fn4)

In the LeT model (Machado [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR22 "Machado, A. (1997). Learning the temporal dynamics of behavior. Psychological Review, 104, 241–265.")), *R*(*t*) is defined as

$$
\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} R(t) &=&A\sum\limits_{n\geqq 1}W_{n}(t)X_{n}(t) \\ &=&\sum\limits_{n\geqq 1}\left\{AW_{n}(t)\right\}X_{n}(t), \end{array}
$$

where *W* *n* (*t*) is the associative strength function of state *n* (*n* = 1, 2, 3, …) at time *t*, and *A* is a positive constant. Since $AW_{n}(t)\geqq 0$ for all *n* and *t*, the series *R*(*t*) contains no negative term. Thus, the LeT model cannot include inhibitive processes that reduce the likelihood that a subject will respond *as if* a particular interval has elapsed. With *X* *n* (*t*) in our PD model, the notion of clocks is changed from the behavioural states in the LeT model and permits the use of negative terms.

### Model of operant response; function $\protect \underline {\overline {R_{s}(t)}}$

In the current study, the value *R* of a response rate at a unit time is defined as the value of the ratio of the mean number *n* of responses at the unit time to the maximal mean number *n* *m* of responses per unit time, namely $R = \frac {\,n\,}{\,n_{m}\,}$. The value of the response rate is nonnegative and does not exceed one; the operant response function $\underline {\overline {R_{s}(t)}}$ may be defined as

$$
\underline{\overline{R_{s}(t)}} = \left\{\begin{array}{lll} \,1 &(\text{if } R_{s}(t)>1),\\ \,R_{s}(t) &(\text{if } 0\leqq R_{s}(t)\leqq 1),\\ \,0 &(\text{if } R_{s}(t)<0). \end{array}\right.
$$

The psychometric function *R* *s* (*t*), the result of the processes of the *mixer*, becomes $\overline {\underline {R_{s}(t)}}$ when it leads to the *response*. $\frac {1}{\,\lambda \,}$ is assumed to be 15 seconds in the example presented in the figure

Empirical results show that the timing behaviour of an animal has a scalar property. This is demonstrated by the fact that the graphs of the timing-response functions for PI schedules in the same animal are almost identical following a linear transformation expressed by some matrix $\left (\begin {array}{ll}a&0\\0&b\end {array}\right )$, where *a* and *b* are nonzero real numbers, even if their functions are created under different FI durations in the PI schedule (see Fig. [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig4) in Cheng and Meck ([2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR6 "Cheng, R.K., & Meck, W.H (2007). Prenatal choline supplementation increases sensitivity to time by reducing non-scalar sources of variance in adult temporal processing.

Also see Fig. 1 in Oprisan and Buhusi ([2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR30 "Oprisan, S.A., & Buhusi, C.V (2013).

Properties of the internal clock: First- and second-order principles of subjective time. Annual Review of Psychology, 65, 743–771.")) for human peak-interval timing). The scalar property is one of the starting points of SET (Church [2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR9 "Church, R.M. (2003).

Scalar expectancy theory and Weber’s law in animal timing. Psychological Review, 84, 279–325.")). It can be shown mathematically that the system of functions *R* *s* (*t*) has the scalar property if and only if *m* does not change and *c* *n* (*s*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, ... , *m*) do not change their ratio. Generally speaking, the system of $\overline {\underline {R_{s}(t)}}$ does not have the scalar property, but if *R* *s* (*t*) ≦ 1 in its total domain, which is observed in most cases, then $\overline {\underline {R_{s}(t)}}$ has the scalar property.

### Total model

Figure [6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig6) illustrates an example of our total model of operant responses.

**Fig. 6**

[![figure 6](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10827-014-0542-4/MediaObjects/10827_2014_542_Fig6_HTML.gif)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4/figures/6)

Example (*m* = 3) of our model of the timing of operant responses. Memory contributes to the value the *clocks* assigned to *λ*, and it influences the *regulator* in fixing *c* *n* (*s*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, … , *m*). The *mixer* automatically makes *R* *s* (*t*) the sum of *c* *n* (*s*)*X* *n* (*t*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, … , *m*). *R* *s* (*t*) is the source of $\overline {\underline {R_{s}(t)}}$, which is produced by the *response*

[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4/figures/6)

The interval $\frac {1}{\,\lambda \,}(>0)$ between the peak times of successive *clocks* will be called “the basic period.” The reciprocal, *λ*, will be called the “speed” of the clock. That is, as the basic period gets smaller, the *clock* ticks at a faster rate. On the other hand, as the basic period increases, the *clock* ticks at a slower rate.

Our model assumes that *memory* contributes to the process through which *clocks* set *λ* to a suitable value; this is based on the length of the FI presented in the early trials of the experiment. *Memory* sends the information about *λ* to the *clocks*, and *memory* can recalibrate the value after experiencing additional FI trials. Our typical $\frac {1}{\,\lambda \,}$ setting in the examples in the figure is 15 seconds; in other words, each clock has a length that is 15 seconds longer than the preceding clock.

*Memory* also contributes to the process through which the *regulator* sets *c* *n* (*s*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, … , *m*). An example of *R* *s* (*t*) is presented in the left-hand panel of Fig. [5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig5). In the figure, the coefficients *c* 0(*s*) and *c* 2(*s*) are positive, because the graphs of *c* 0(*s*)*X* 0(*t*) and *c* 2(*s*)*X* 2(*t*), having peak times of 0 $(=\frac {0}{\,\lambda \,})$ seconds and 30 $(=\frac {2}{\,\lambda \,})$ seconds, respectively, are located above the horizontal axis. The coefficients *c* 1(*s*) and *c* 3(*s*) are negative, because the graphs of *c* 1(*s*)*X* 1(*t*) and *c* 3(*s*)*X* 3(*t*), having peak times of 15 $(=\frac {1}{\,\lambda \,})$ seconds and 45 $(=\frac {3}{\,\lambda \,})$ seconds, respectively, are located below the horizontal axis. In this example, clocks *X* 1(*t*) and *X* 3(*t*) may be used in the *mixer* for judging, *“It is not 30 seconds yet”* and *“It is not 30 seconds anymore,”* at strengths |*c* 1(*s*)| and |*c* 3(*s*)|, respectively.

The basic idea of the function of the *mixer*, the simple mathematical summation, is similar to that of the generalization gradients and the peak shift by Spence ([1937](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR33 "Spence, K.W.

Figure [7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig7) shows a simplified chart of a peak shift.

The two thin curves are the graphs of *c* 0(*s*) (near the horizontal line 0.0) and *c* 2(*s*) (above, its *top* is outside the range presented in the figure). The two broken curves are the graphs of *c* 1(*s*)*X* 1(*t*) (*left*) and *c* 3(*s*)*X* 3(*t*) (*right*), whose ratio determines the shape of $\overline {\underline {R_{s}(t)}}$

## Materials and methods

### Animals and apparatus

Twelve male Wistar rats were used: \[RatsA\] RatA1, RatA2, …, RatA6; \[RatsB\] RatB1, RatB2, ..., RatB6. Each of the operant chambers was equipped with a pellet dispenser, a lever, a light, and a CCD camera. One computer controlled all the experimental events and recorded separately the time at which each event and response occurred. Another computer, which was connected to audio amplifiers, produced tone stimuli.

### Procedure

Let PI-*T* denote a PI procedure of *T* seconds, where *T* = 20, 30, and 45. After lever-pressing was shaped in each subject, the rats were exposed to the PI procedures listed in Table [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Tab1).

**Table 1 Duration of PI to which RatsA and RatsB were exposed**

[Full size table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4/tables/1)

Each FI trial started with a continuous tone, and the rat received a pellet reinforcer the first time it pressed the lever while *T* < *t* < 3 *T*, for the specified *T*. The continuous tone stopped when the rat received the reinforcement, and this was followed by a silent intertrial interval (ITI) of *T* seconds.[Footnote 5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fn5) If the rat did not respond while *T* < *t* < 3 *T*, then a silent ITI of *T* s was presented without reinforcement. During the probe trials, the tone stimulus lasted 3*T* s and was followed by a silent ITI of *T* s.

One session consisted of 100 FI trials and 30 probe trials. The order was pseudorandom; the initial 10 trials were FI schedules, and the remaining 120 trials consisted of 30 units of four trials each, where each unit included one probe trial and three FI trials in random order. One experimental session occurred each day for 70 days.

### Data analysis

The analysis was based on the data from all the probe trials, i.e., non-food cycles, in the 21st through 70th sessions. The mean and individual response rates during the initial 3*T* seconds of each session were fit with the explicit solutions: Eq. ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ1)) for SET and Eq. ([9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ9)) (with Eq. ([8](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ8))) for the Poisson decomposition.

## Results

### Fit by Pearson’s correlation coefficient and AIC

The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is defined to be

$$
\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} \text{AIC}&=&-2\ln(\text{maximum likelihood})\\ &&+2(\text{number of adjusted parameters}). \end{array}
$$

This criterion indicates which of two models best describes a given data set, based on both how well it accounts for the variation in the data and on how few free parameters it has; if a model has a smaller AIC, then it is considered to be the better model based on these two criteria (Akaike [1974](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR1 "Akaike, H. (1974). A new look at the statistical model identification. IEEE Transaction Automatic Control, 19, 716–723.")).[Footnote 6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fn6)

We took some steps to reduce the number of free parameters in Eq. ([7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ7)) and therefore to reduce the value of its AIC. To this end, our standard setting was *m* = 3, which incorporated into the model the assumption that the rats had used the clocks *X* 0(*t*), *X* 1(*t*), *X* 2(*t*), and *X* 3(*t*). In our first model for each session *s*, there were five free parameters: *λ*, *c* 0(*s*), *c* 1(*s*), *c* 2(*s*), and *c* 3(*s*).

We calculated Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (*r*) in addition to the AIC and used both these values to aid in identifying the model that best accounted for the data. An example using the same data set and the best-fitting functions based on SET and the Poisson decomposition are shown in Fig. [9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig9).

SET and PD have similar values of *r* and AIC; both of them fit well, and they are almost equally good as mathematical models for this data set, even though we can easily observe a difference in the shapes of the curves

### Basic period of clocks

Fitting the PD model to these data allowed the identification of the basic period $\frac {\,1\,}{\,\lambda \,}$ (s) of the clocks that, according to the proposed model, form part of the process that the subjects used to time the interval. The basic period $\frac {\,1\,}{\,\lambda \,}$ calculated for each session is presented in Fig. [11](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig11).

### Coefficients identified by Poisson decomposition

After fitting the PD model, the coefficients *c* *n* (*s*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, 3; *s* = 21, 22, 23, …, 70) were extracted from the data. An example of a typical graph of *c* *n* (*s*) (*n* = 0, 1, 2, 3) is shown in Fig. [12](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig12).

## Discussion

Since Yi ([2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR36 "Yi, L. (2007). Applications of timing theories to a peak procedure. Behavioural Processes, 75, 188–198.")) has already compared the SET and the LeT models in terms of goodness of fit and complexity, and has concluded that both models do equally well, we will not further consider the LeT model.

### Model of clocks; functions *X* *n* (*t*)

Generally speaking, it is possible that $\frac {\,d\,}{\,dt\,}X_{0}(t)$ is not a proportional function of *X* 0(*t*). It may be another function, such as $\frac {\,d\,}{\,dt\,}X_{0}(t)=-\lambda \left \{X_{0}(t)\right \}^{\alpha }$ (*α* > 0 and *α* ≠ 1; for example, $\alpha =\frac {\,1\,}{\,2\,}$ by Bernoulli), $\frac {\,d\,}{\,dt\,}X_{0}(t)=-\lambda \ln \left \{X_{0}(t)+1\right \}$, or other possibilities. Moreover, $\frac {\,d\,}{\,dt\,}X_{0}(t)$ may depend not only on the amount of water in the container used in the model but also on the size and shape of the hole, as well as on the shape of the container. In fact, there exist many options. Nevertheless, we assumed simply that $\frac {\,d\,}{\,dt\,}X_{0}(t)$ depends only on the amount of water *X* 0(*t*), and that $\frac {d}{\,dt\,}X_{0}(t)$ is proportional to *X* 0(*t*). Additionally, we assumed simply that $\frac {d}{\,dt\,}X_{n}(t)$ depends only on *X* *n* − 1(*t*)−*X* *n* (*t*) and that $\frac {d}{\,dt\,}X_{n}(t)$ is proportional to *X* *n* − 1(*t*)−*X* *n* (*t*) (for any *n* = 1, 2, 3, …) with the same proportional coefficient *λ*. The reasons for our choice are as follows:

1.  (i)
    
    The set of Eqs. ([3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ3)) and ([5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Equ5)) is simple.
    
2.  (ii)
    
    The solutions of the differential equations are gamma density functions whose peak times are equidistant.
    

We note that gamma density functions are also the foundation of the behavioural theory-of-timing (BeT) stochastic counter model.

### Model of regulator; functions *c* *n* (*s*)*X* *n* (*t*)

We assumed that the *c* *n* (*s*) are constant even within sessions. Examining the dynamical fit for the *c* *n* (*s*) on *s* is an appropriate and important project for future studies of learning.

### Model of the mixer; function *R* *s* (*t*)

In the case of *c* *n* (*s*)=0, the living organism hears nothing from the *n*th clock. If it does not use the clock *X* *n* (*t*), then we can reduce the AIC value of PD by up to 2 for each *n*.

If we let

$$
R_{s}(t)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^{m}c_{n}(s)X_{n}(t)+R_{0},
$$

using constant *R* 0, then *R* 0 should be 0. The reason is as follows: in the trial interval 0 ≦ *t* ≦ *t* 1, if *t* 1 → +∞ and *t* → +∞, then *R* *s* (*t*) → 0; i.e., if a probe trial lasts too long, then the rat will no longer respond at all by the end of the trial.

### Model of operant response; function $\underline {\overline {R_{s}(t)}}$

In our model, the equation $\underline {\overline {R_{s}(t)}}=R_{s}(t)$ holds when 0 ≦ *R* *s* (*t*) ≦ 1, but the function $\underline {\overline {R_{s}(t)}}$ could be defined as another function, depending on the “hardware,” such as an animal’s motor system.

### Basic speed of clocks

In a PI-30 schedule, for example, if $\frac {1}{\,\lambda \,}=15$ (s), then we may say, roughly, that a rat times the interval of 30 s by using the 15 s and 45 s clocks for inhibition, in addition to the 30 s main clock.

### Coefficients by Poisson decomposition

In Sections [2.2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Sec6) and [5.2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Sec20), we noted that the weights *c* *n* (*s*) are assumed to be constant within a session. From Table [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Tab2), moreover, we may assume that the values of *c* 0(*s*), *c* 1(*s*), *c* 2(*s*), and *c* 3(*s*) are stable against changes in the FI length, and that they are almost constant in each rat from the 21st to the 70th sessions. This implies that the rats cope with the change in the FI length primarily by changing the basic period of their clocks. The weights of *c* 0(*s*), *c* 1(*s*), *c* 2(*s*), and *c* 3(*s*) express the organism’s proper relative use of clocks *X* 0(*t*), *X* 1(*t*), *X* 2(*t*), and *X* 3(*t*), and the weights are almost fixed, which implies a transposition.

Generally, in light of the mathematical fact noted in Section [2.4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Sec8), the scalar property is present. Thus, the scalar property can be considered to be a transposition.

### Fit by Pearson’s correlation coefficient and AIC

With *c* 0(*s*), *c* 1(*s*), *c* 2(*s*), and *c* 3(*s*) fixed for each rat to the values presented in Table [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Tab2), we again calculated the fits for PD. Let PD$(\overrightarrow {c\,})$ represent the process used to fit this revised version of the PD model to the data. In PD$(\overrightarrow {c\,})$, since there is only one free parameter *λ*, its AIC value is reduced by the reduction in the number of free parameters. Incidentally, it was not possible to make a similar reduction in the number of free parameters in the SET equation using the current data and analysis; even the ratio $\frac {\,t_{0}\,}{\,b\,}$, the mean over the standard deviation, scattered hopelessly. Table [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Tab3) presents a comparison of the AIC values between SET, PD, and PD$(\overrightarrow {c\,})$.

**Table 3 The number of sessions for which each of the three models produced AIC values that were, among the three models compared, the best (lowest), worst (highest), or intermediate**

[Full size table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4/tables/3)

Though the mean of the correlation coefficients for PD$(\overrightarrow {c\,})$ is lower (worse) by about 0.013 than the mean of the correlation coefficients for SET (Fig. [14](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig14)), PD$(\overrightarrow {c\,})$ has rather better AIC values than does SET (Table [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Tab3)).

**Fig. 14**

[![figure 14](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10827-014-0542-4/MediaObjects/10827_2014_542_Fig14_HTML.gif)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4/figures/14)

Frequency distribution of the correlation coefficients for the fit with PD $(\protect \overrightarrow {c})$ for 600 sessions. The mean correlation coefficient was 0.946; the method through which this mean was calculated is presented in the [A](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#App1)Appendix

[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4/figures/14)

Obtaining the weights *c* *n* (*s*) using PD, we first observed that they were approximately constant. Even with this assumption which was only approximately met by the data, PD$(\overrightarrow {c\,})$ fit the data far better, as judged by AIC values, than did SET. Therefore, we propose that PD and PD$(\overrightarrow {c\,})$ may be useful additions to SET in the analysis of timing behaviour.

### Total model

“Additions to SET” in the preceding section may sound strange, because this paper might have appeared to be a rival for SET. Indeed, asymmetrically shaped graphs, such as Fig. 4 in Cheng and Meck ([2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR6 "Cheng, R.K., & Meck, W.H (2007). Prenatal choline supplementation increases sensitivity to time by reducing non-scalar sources of variance in adult temporal processing. Brain Research, 1186, 242–254.")), Fig. 1 in Oprisan and Buhusi ([2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR30 "Oprisan, S.A., & Buhusi, C.V (2013). Why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing?. BMC Neuroscience, 14, 84.")), Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig1) in McAuley et al. ([2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR21 "McAuley, J.D., Miller, J.P., Pang, K.C.H. (2006). Modeling the effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 on timing in rats. Behavioral Neuroscience, 120, 1163–1168.")) and others, turned out to be good applications for the PD model. Symmetrically shaped graphs, such as Fig. [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig2) in Church ([1984](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR7 "Church, R.M. (1984). Properties of the internal clock. Annals of The New York Academy of Sciences, 423, 566–582.")), Fig. [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig3) in Church et al. ([1991](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR8 "Church, R.M., Miller, K.D., Meck, W.H., Gibbon, J. (1991). Symmetrical and asymmetrical sources of variance in temporal generalization. Animal Learning & Behavior, 19, 207–214.")), Figs. [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig2) and [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig3) in Allman et al. ([2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR2 "Allman, M.J., Teki, S., Griffiths, T.D., Meck, W.H (2014). Properties of the internal clock: First- and second-order principles of subjective time.

Why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing?. BMC Neuroscience, 14, 84.")) and others, are similar, but are also still good applications for the SET model.

It is inevitable that a theme of our future research will be to apply our model to various other timing schedules, such as simultaneous temporal processing (for example, see Fig. 11 in Church ([1984](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR7 "Church, R.M. (1984). Properties of the internal clock. Annals of The New York Academy of Sciences, 423, 566–582."))). Also we regard it as an important theme for future research to check whether our model is compatible and cooperative to with the striatal beat-frequency (SBF) model, as in Oprisan and Buhusi ([2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR30 "Oprisan, S.A., & Buhusi, C.V (2013). Why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing?. BMC Neuroscience, 14, 84."); also see Fig. 4 in Oprisan and Buhusi [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#ref-CR30 "Oprisan, S.A., & Buhusi, C.V (2013). Why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing?. BMC Neuroscience, 14, 84.")).

The mean value of the correlation coefficients

For each correlation coefficient *r*, after normalization by Fisher’s *z*′ transformation (*r*\-to- *z*′ transformation) $z^{\prime } = \frac {\,1\,}{\,2\,}\ln \frac {\,1 + r\,}{\,1 - r\,}$, we calculated the arithmetic mean $\overline {z^{\prime }}$ of *z*′. Then we converted back to get the mean $\overline {r}$ shown in all panels in Figs. [10](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig10) and [14](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-014-0542-4#Fig14).
