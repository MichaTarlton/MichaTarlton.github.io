How I search and read scientific papers now‚Ä¶ 

A üßµ

After trying many methods of reading research papers effectively, I have now (at least) settled on this format. 

[@PhDVoice](https://twitter.com/PhDVoice) [@ThePhDPlace](https://twitter.com/ThePhDPlace) [@PhD_Genie](https://twitter.com/PhD_Genie) [@OpenAcademics](https://twitter.com/OpenAcademics) [#AcademicChatter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AcademicChatter)  [#AcademicTwitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AcademicTwitter)  [#scicomm](https://twitter.com/hashtag/scicomm)  [#STEM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/STEM) 

I think it's just 4 step method! At first, it may feel time-consuming but once you get a grip on it then it's quite easy.

1.I first start by searching for the main topic that I am working on -- [#AntibioticResistance](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AntibioticResistance)  in [@OK_Maps](https://twitter.com/OK_Maps). Now ‚ÄúOpen Knowledge Maps‚Äù creates a visual knowledge map of the topic you're searching for. Also, lets you know if a paper has open access.

Sample: [pic.twitter.com/3Q1QtRpiSp](https://twitter.com/VnVrinda/status/1546541214723616768/photo/1)

2.Then, I select a few papers and then head towards [@Inciteful_xyz](https://twitter.com/Inciteful_xyz) to build a network of papers and for literature connects. 

I. Search for your main paper to build a network 

Sample: [pic.twitter.com/0JfBnMjIO0](https://twitter.com/VnVrinda/status/1546544375769055232/photo/1)

II. Select seed papers and create your network and filter out important papers. Also, you can save (seed papers) directly into Zotero.

III. Your search result will also show-- Recent papers by the top 100 authors and The most important recent papers 

Sample: [pic.twitter.com/Yf3zDuscX2](https://twitter.com/VnVrinda/status/1546545237744668674/photo/1)

![3_1546545233990754310](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXZuskUXoAYkMN2.jpg)

IV: Along with other data like -- Top authors and Journals 

Sample: [pic.twitter.com/ypatCv4Eds](https://twitter.com/VnVrinda/status/1546545446096609281/photo/1)

![3_1546545441633869826](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXZu4p2WIAI3WXX.jpg)

For literature connects (especially for interdisciplinary research it's such a great tool)-- search for two main papers and get a detailed and filtered-out map.

Sample: [pic.twitter.com/0U9Mptssmb](https://twitter.com/VnVrinda/status/1546545938277203969/photo/1)

[3.Now](http://3.Now), I head over to [@scholarcy](https://twitter.com/scholarcy) (they also have chrome extension) where you make flashcards. These flashcards are tiny breakdowns of the entire paper that highlights important parts of the paper.

[4.Science](http://4.Science) research assistant: While reading a paper, we often come across various terms, and methods, of anything which we are not familiar with. I use, the particular chrome extension called--

Science research assistant which helps to find a word or about anything which you need further reading. As soon as you select a word, it opens in 5 different tabs and lets you know the latest papers, news and web searches.

Note: I do highlight important sentences or methods in the pdf and save them. To use them later if I am presenting or just to refer back. 

Anyways, I hope these points turn out to be useful for you. 

Thank you for reading!

Addendum: someone mentioned using www.sumnotes.net to extract all notes and highlights from pdfs.
