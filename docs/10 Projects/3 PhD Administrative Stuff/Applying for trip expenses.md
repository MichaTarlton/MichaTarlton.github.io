# How to apply for trip expenses

Need to figure this out
> Every planned trip has to be registered in the SAP/DFØ system. You can use the budget number for your “PhD driftsmidler” in the form.
> Should you have any question, I believe that you can contact Belinda.

From Belinda 
> Yes, you can pay the costs with your personal card, and apply for a reimbursement through DFØ.
> 
> If you need help relating to reimbursement claim in DFØ, [reiseregning@oslomet.no](mailto:reiseregning@oslomet.no) can be contacted :)


All planning must be done through berg-hansen.
So do it via [Logg inn - Berg Hansen](https://www.berg-hansen.no/logg-inn/)
