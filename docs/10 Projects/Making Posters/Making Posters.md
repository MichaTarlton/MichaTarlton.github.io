# Three ideas for posters
- SNN-DRL Neuromorphics
- SNN- DRL Timing models
- Neural Dynamics
Obviously the top two are the important ones

## SNN-DRL Neuromorphics
- Neuromorphics provide an opportunity for low-energy consumption, rapid, reactive, systems
- This next-generation hardware utilizes a neuroscience-inspired AI model known as Spiking Neural Networks
- This method is able to achieve dense informational

# Outline
- Should have a Title, Motivation, Goal, Methods, Results
- in lieu of results, I should put …”plans”?
