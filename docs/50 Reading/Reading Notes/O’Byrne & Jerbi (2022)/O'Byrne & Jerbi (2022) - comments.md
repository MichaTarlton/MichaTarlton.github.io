> ![[O'Byrne & Jerbi (2022) - topics#****Control parameter****]]

What I want to do is find a way to tune control parameters for neuronal dynamics and/or self organizing learning systems.
 
The reason we will need something like this is to avoid a runaway or under-energetic system. Another way to phrase is to avoid an exploding or vanishing gradient in the phase space.
