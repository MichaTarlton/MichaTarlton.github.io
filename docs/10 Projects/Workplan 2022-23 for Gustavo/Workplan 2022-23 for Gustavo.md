# Email / outline
It is time to make the workplans again. Because the group has grown substantially, I decided to try a different system as an attempt to save time for all of us and to facilitate documentation.

In this e-mail, there is a series of questions regarding your activities at OsloMet and beyond. Please have in mind that these questions only refer to activities that may have had or that might have impact in the workplan.

**I ask you to answer each question twice**.

-   The first time referring to the activities performed during the Fall Semester of 2022
-   The second time referring to the predicted, estimated or expected activities to be performed during the Spring Semester of 2023

Be advised to define clearly which answers refer to each period. Example: all the answers for 2022 are grouped first, and all the answers for 2023 are grouped afterwards.

Because assigning tasks for the next semester depends on this workplan, within possibility, I ask you to reply until Monday 28th.

I thank you for your cooperation,

G.
