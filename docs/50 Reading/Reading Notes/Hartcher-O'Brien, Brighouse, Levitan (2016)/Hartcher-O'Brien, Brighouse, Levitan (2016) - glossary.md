# Glossary
As pulled directly from paper
## Unified versus Dissociable Mechanisms:
A unified mechanism would perform all of the computations needed for different timing tasks, such as estimation of rate and duration. Dissociable mechanisms would calculate such properties separately, and may in part rely in different neural networks.
    
## Rate:
The rate of a stimulus is defined as the periodicity of a stimulus over time, for instance, how quickly a light is flashing.
    
## Duration:
Duration is the time that elapses between two markers, often the onset and offset markers of a stimulus. The duration judgement provides an estimate of how long a light is on.
    
## Inter-Onset Intervals (IOIs):
The inter-onset interval is the difference in time between two successful “starts”. For instance, if a light is on for 13 ms, then off for 27 ms before turning on again, the IOI is 40 ms. The IOI is the inverse of the rate for a periodic stimulus.
    
## Relative Judgements/Absolute Judgements:
A relative judgement is one made by comparing a stimulus to another stimulus or to a reference. For instance, intervals could be judged as long or short relative to some internal standard. An absolute judgement is made without reference to another stimulus, and might be used, for instance, in estimating time to contact.
    
## Weber's Law:
The just noticeable difference (which is the amount that a stimulus has to be changed for the difference to be noticeable) between two stimuli is proportional to the magnitude of the stimulus. This has been particularly important in studies of duration perception.
    
## Content/Vehicle:
Content: what is represented by an item. Vehicle: the item that does the representing. For a clock model to allow us to make judgments of duration (or rate) the clock model must have some (biological) state or states that represent a duration (or rate), leading us to make the judgement we do. The *content* of that representation is revealed by our judgment of duration (or rate), the biological state or states of the model that have this content are the *vehicle* of that representation. On a naive view of representing time, for example, the content (the judged duration or rate) is represented by a duration or rate of a biological process (the vehicle).
    
## Beat Frequency:
The beat frequency refers to the oscillatory rate at which a subpopulation of in phase neurons respond, and the “beat period” defines the time span between consecutive moments at which the subpopulation of neurons respond in phase.
    
## Striatal and olivocerebellar networks:
Both the striatal and the olivocerebellar networks have repeatedly been identified as contributing to the coding of duration and rate. The striatum is a portion of the basal ganglia that receives inputs from the entire neural cortex and has been proposed as a key part of the neural timing system, especially for the beat frequency model. Striatal medium spiny neurons fire in response to stimulation at different frequencies and are used for timing durations in the seconds to minutes time scales. The striatal network (striato-thalamo-cortical network which is composed of the putamen, caudate, thalamus, pre- SMA/SMA, premotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) responses are strongest when coding stimulus rate. The olivocerebellar network, comprising the inferior olive and the cerebellum, has been shown to be more active for duration-based timing.
    
## Neural adaptation:
Neural adaptation refers to the change in some property of the response of a neuron or set of neurons over time, such as a change in firing rate due to repeated exposure to a particular stimulus.
    
## Entrainment:
Entrainment occurs when neural oscillators synchronise their response to the frequency of an external stimulus. Entrainment is maximal at lower range beat frequencies.
