# Starting with Brain Inspired computing needs a master plan

Fig. 2 | The landscape of neuromorphic systems. Neuromorphic chips can be classified as either modelling biological systems or applying brain-inspired principles to novel computing applications. They may be further subdivided into those based on digital CMOS with novel architecture (for example, spikes may be simulated in the digital domain rather than implemented as analogue voltages) and those implemented using some degree of analogue circuitry. In all cases, however, they share at least some of the properties listed on the right-hand side, which distinguish them from conventional CMOS chips. Here we classify examples of recently developed neuromorphic chips. Further details of each can be found in the relevant reference: Neurogrid26, BrainSclaseS27, MNIFAT28, DYNAP29, DYNAP-SEL30, ROLLS31, Spirit32, ReASOn33, DeepSouth34, SpiNNaker35, IBM TrueNorth36, Intel Loihi37, Tianjic38, ODIN39 and the Intel SNN chip40. aImplemented with memristors.
