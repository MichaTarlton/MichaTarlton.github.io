> Geometric Deep Learning is an umbrella term we introduced in [5] referring to recent attempts to come up with a geometric unification of ML similar to Kleinâ€™s Erlangen Programme. It serves two purposes: first, to provide a common mathematical framework to derive the most successful neural network architectures, and second, give a constructive procedure to build future architectures in a principled way.
