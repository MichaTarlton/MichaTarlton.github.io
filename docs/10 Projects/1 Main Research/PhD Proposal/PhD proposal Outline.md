Taking notes from Rabindra’s proposal as well as provided guidelines(where is this?)

I literally can’t find any particular guidelines to the proposal .

So I guess I’m just going off Rabindras

# 1 Introduction 

## Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
- Offline reactive task learning with generalization

##  DRL  in Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)
- Biologically plausible model
	- Biologically Plausible Model of learning
	- Neuromorphic Hardware Applications
## Temporal-Difference TD Learning
- Temporal difference in RL
- Temporal Learning in SNN
	- STDP
	- Phase encoding 
	- synfire?
- Allows for experimentation in Temporal Difference Learning using continuous phase data


# 2 Related Work
- Legendre Memory Units 
- Payuer et al. 2021
	- eligibility traces

# 3 Research Questions
- Can we train DRL models which can learn for different time scales and environmental changes
- Can we encode the memory of different time scales into the “state” of the network
	- That is, can we rely on “in-computation” memory to encode optimal network configurations
- Can we effectively utilize “recurrentness” in a network to effect an echo state memory
- Can we effectively utilize properties of spiking networks (and particularly timing properties) to…
	-  train the network
		- STDP
	- encode memory into the spiking phases

Our model needs to:
	Utilize spike-timing properties in an SNN to train offline to a task defined by a dynamical reward environment. The task environment in which the model network learns, may change over time, and in the response the network must retain a “memory” of previous optimizations to inform future optimizations.

# 5 Ethics and Explainability

# 6 Progress Plan
I have illustrated my progress plan below. My PhD program will extend for four years and I plan to include teaching and supervision during this time in addition to this project. My
