See: [[Q-Learning]], 

Originally proposed in [[@mnihHumanlevelControlDeep2015]]

They cover this somewhat and mention a bunch of different methods in [[@hesselRainbowCombiningImprovements201]]
But essentially this is an extension of [[Q-Learning v. SARSA|Q-Learning]] into a Deep learning framework.
Where Q-Learning is a RL method, and not really thrown into a DL context much.
