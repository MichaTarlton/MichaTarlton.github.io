> *“[[scalar expectancy theory]] the most influential timing model up to now - was developed by Gibbon (1977), and further improved by Church (1984). It expands on the memory stage of Treisman’s internal clock by incorporating: a working memory component, a multiplicative factor for storage in a reference memory, and a decision rule to determine if ‘yes’ or ‘no’ the duration being measured is similar to previously encoded durations”* [(p. 147)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBVFC5PX?page=2&annotation=YCYFJVDD)
