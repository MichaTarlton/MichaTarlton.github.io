## Morris-Lecar Neurons
[Morris-Lecar model - Scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Morris-Lecar_model)

## Excitatory / Inhibitory (EIO)
- See reference to EIO-SBF model
> The main idea behind the EIO–SBF model is that different ranges of frequency bands are related to different cognitive functions. For example, the gamma oscillators entrained in

## Unbound Accumulator Problem
- self-explanatory perhaps 

## Scalar Timing Theory (STT)
- an information-processing model derived from SET − Gibbon et al., 1984)
## Chronotropy

## Ramping Activity
- Mentioned in [[@jazayeriNeuralMechanismSensing2015]]
	- > We recorded neural activity in parietal cortex of monkeys in a time reproduction task. 
	- Monkeys were trained to measure and immediately afterward reproduce different sample intervals. While measuring an interval, neural responses had a nonlinear profile that increased with the duration of the sample interval. 

	- Activity was reset during the transition from measurement to production and was followed by a **ramping activity** whose slope encoded the previously measured sample interval. 
	
	- We found that firing rates at the end of the measurement epoch were correlated with both the slope of the ramp and the monkey's corresponding production interval on a trial-by-trial basis. 
	
	- Analysis of response dynamics further linked the rate of change of firing rates in the measurement epoch to the slope of the ramp in the production epoch. These observations suggest that, during time reproduction, an interval is measured prospectively in relation to the desired motor plan to reproduce that interval.
- From [Ramping activity is a cortical mechanism of temporal control of action - PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860273/)
	- > A fundamental feature of the mammalian cortex is to guide movements in time. 
	- One common pattern of neural activity observed across cortical regions during temporal control of action is **ramping activity**. 
	- **==Ramping activity** can be defined as consistent increases or decreases in neuronal firing rate across behaviorally relevant epochs of time==. 
	- Prefrontal brain regions, including medial frontal and lateral prefrontal cortex, are critical for temporal control of action. Ramping is among the most common pattern of neural activity in these prefrontal areas during behavioral tasks. 
	- Finally, stimulating prefrontal neurons in medial frontal cortex can influence the timing of movement. These data can be helpful in approaching human diseases with impaired temporal of action, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Cortical ramping activity might contribute to new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these and other debilitating human diseases.
- They also talk about it in length in this paper
	- Though to them it is an indicative effect of an external signal as opposed to the activity of encoding something directly
## Double - Summation (DS)
- Their extension to the SBF
- uhhhh how to describe this….
- I think it requires some sort of summation of two or more brain regions in order to “start” the coincidence detector? #q
