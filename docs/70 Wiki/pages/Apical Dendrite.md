# Apical Dendrite
> bursting may be modulated by feedback synapses on apical dendrites18,38, feedback could control plasticity in the basal dendrites via control of bursting.

> Dendrite arbors formed by apical dendrites are the means by which synaptic inputs into a cell are [integrated.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Integrated_spike&action=edit&redlink=1 "Integrated spike (page does not exist)")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apical_dendrite#cite_note-3rd-3) The apical dendrites in these regions contribute significantly to [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory"), [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning "Learning"), and sensory associations by modulating the [excitatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory "Excitatory") and [inhibitory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory "Inhibitory") signals received by the pyramidal cells.
> Apical dendrites are the most distal along the ascending trunk, and reside in layer 1. These distal apical dendrites receive synaptic input from related cortical as well as globally modulatory subcortical projections.
