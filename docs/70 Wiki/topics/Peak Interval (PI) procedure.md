Branched from [[Interval Timing]] and [[Fixed Interval (FI) procedure]]

From [[@petterIntegratingModelsInterval2018]]
> **Peak-interval procedure**
> the peak-interval procedure is a discrete-trial duration re-production procedure. A percentage of trials are fixed-interval trials, where the subject’s first response after a target duration (e.g., 30 s) is reinforced. There are also unreinforced probe trials interleaved with the fixed-interval trials. The omission of reward allows timing behavior to be assessed without the interruption of reward, allowing for the individual trials analysis of ‘stop’ and ‘start’ responses [\[87\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318301931?via%3Dihub#bib0435).





Looks like they talk about this in Gustavo’s thesis [[mello 2016]] as I copied it into the glossary

# PI with gaps
[[@swearingenPatternRespondingPeakInterval2010]]

> In PI trials, the to-be-timed signal is presented but subject’s responses are not reinforced; typically, in PI trials the average response rate increases after the onset of the to-be-timed signal, reaches a peak about the time when subjects’ responses were (sometimes) reinforced, and declines afterwards ([Catania, 1970](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R19); [Church, 1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R21)) ([Figure 1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/figure/F1/)). 
> 
> During gap trials, a brief interruption (gap) of the to-be-timed signal prompts a delay in response relative to PI trials by about the duration of the gap, suggesting that on average subjects retain in working memory the pre-gap interval and resume timing after the gap where they left off before the gap, a response mode (alternative) called stop (e.g., [Church, 1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R21); [S. Roberts & Church, 1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R48)) ([Figure 1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/figure/F1/)).
> 
> However, a quite different response pattern is observed in the reversed version of the PI procedure ([Buhusi & Meck, 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R7)), in which subjects (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R7) time the absence of a signal (e.g., in the dark) and their timing is interrupted by a signaled (e.g., illuminated) gap ([Figure 1B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/figure/F1/)): Subjects delay their response function after the gap for a duration that is approximately the sum of the gap and pre-gap intervals, suggesting that on average they restart the entire timing process after the gap, using a reset response ([Buhusi & Meck, 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964407/#R7)).

> **The peak-interval (PI) procedure with gaps**
> Subjects time the presence of a signal (Standard, panel A) or the absence of a signal (Reversed, panel B). Subjects are randomly presented with fixed-interval (FI) trials, peak-interval (PI) trials, and gap trials in which the to-be-timed signal is interrupted by a retention-interval (gap). The upper graphs show that in PI trials the average response rate peaks at the to-be-timed interval, and that the presentation of a gap delays the response function. \* = reinforcement.
