> Moreover, any model will need to account for how information from different modalities is timed. Recent work directly comparing tasks, such as temporal order and simultaneity judgements, has shown that different patterns of data arise depending on what participants are asked to do \[[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898886/#R51)\], \[[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898886/#R52)\]. Multisensory studies of both rate and duration can, in tandem with a broad range of other tasks, help probe the plausibility of different models of temporal perception.

## Beat Frequency
If a sub-ensemble's beat frequency is altered by this then this would simultaneously influence duration estimates. 

For example, if a stimulus influences the frequencies of members of a sub-ensemble in quite different ways, such that the time between their successive in phase beats changes from 500 ms to 550 ms, 

then duration estimates driven by this sub-ensemble's striatal neuron will be quite different. 

That is, absent any other mechanism to correct for this kind of change, the striatal neuron that tracks this particular ensemble's beat frequency will be activated by different duration stimuli at some times than at others; 

sometimes that striatal neuron will be active for 500ms stimuli, at other times (after some kind of adaptation or entrainment) for 550 ms stimuli. Given this, we predict that the same physical stimulus duration (as measured by some external clock) will be judged to be of different duration on different occasions: 550 ms will be judged sometimes as 550ms, but after entrainment or adaptation, as 500ms.
