# Membrane Time Constant
> Membrane time constant is the time for the potential to fall from the resting to a fraction (1-l/e), or 63%, of its final value in the charging curve during the application of a small negative current pulse.

So effectively a neuron’s “leak”. 

> The "membrane time constant" of a neuron is simply a way of measuring how quickly a neuron's voltage level decays to its "resting state" after it receives an input signal.

Not sure what the rate actually is though
