## (SFI) serial fixed interval 
In the SFI task, reward delivery is both the timing cue and the reinforcer

## (SDF) normalized spike density functions

## Firing Rate Latencies
???

## COM - Center of Mass

## PST - Pressing Start Times

## Trial
> Briefly, rats were placed in a behavioral box containing a lever positioned over a liquid delivery port and were trained to press the lever to receive water reward. 
> 
> Reward delivery triggered a timer, and reward became available again only after the timer exceeded a FI ranging from 12 s to 60 s in multiples of 12 s. 
> 
> Lever presses occurring after reward delivery but before the FI had elapsed were not reinforced. 
> 
> A FI was maintained for between 18 and 40 rewards before changing to another FI, randomly chosen from the interval set
> 
## Block 
Section of the trial dedicated to a single FI
> We asked how pressing evolved after pressing onset (pressing start times, PSTs) in each trial by aligning on the PST and averaging lever press rates across trials and within blocks of the same FI (Figure 1D).
