#  Types of time learning tasks

## Peak Interval (PI) proceedure

## Peak Interval with Gaps
Used to see if the agent can “pause” their “stopwatch”

> A simple example of this is the transition from a fixed interval to a peak-interval procedure. Initially, the subject is rewarded 100% of the time for a response occurring after a fixed delay from signal onset. Subjects are then transferred to partial reinforcement schedules, and must learn that in addition to the rewarded state, there is a new state where reward is not available.

## Delay ?
Possibly Variable Delay Bisection

## Bi-peak and tri-peak proceedures
Variant of bisection?

as mentioned in [[@yinIntervaltimingProtocolsTheir2017]]
> The bi-peak and tri-peak procedures (e.g., Agostino et al., 2013; Buhusi & Meck, 2009b; Matell & Meck, 1999; Matell et al., 2004; Meck et al., 2012a; Yin & Meck, 2014) can also be used to examine the scalar variability of interval timing and if there is any deviance in the multiple peak times obtained from the same trial.


> As a consequence, although the experimenter may think that there is an operational difference between the bisection and bi-peak procedures there really is not in terms of the subject’s timing behavior – except for how and/or when the data are recorded during the trial. The “switch” point in the bi-peak procedure that is equivalent to the point of bisection in the duration bisection procedure is illustrated in peak functions averaged over many trials by the point of intersection between the Gaussian-like functions associated with the shorter and longer durations as illustrated by Fig. 8.5B or in Yin and Meck (2014 – fig. 1 for example).

## Mixed stimulus averaging'
> Similarly, subjects are capable of spontaneous averaging of intervals. On separate trials rats were trained to associate an auditory stimulus with a short delay to food availability, and a visual stimulus with a long delay. When both modalities were presented simultaneously, subjects averaged the two separate reinforcement times [56].

## Variable Stimulus
> Internal models of timing can also be exposed by manipulating the distribution of intervals. These manipulations have been performed with an operant conditioning task in which the CS–US interval was drawn from a Gaussian whose mean was held fxied across blocks of trials within a session, but whose variance was varied across blocks [ [[@liMiceInferProbabilistic2013|57]] ]. Mice waited longer before approaching the water port when the variance was larger, consistent with the optimal modelbased policy. Intuitively, when variance is large, and thus mice are more uncertain, they will wait longer to increase their confdience that the criterion interval has elapsed.

## Temporal integration
![[@petterIntegratingModelsInterval2018#studies of temporal integration reviews 58 59]]
### And Not sure what this one is, but attached to temp integration
> In these experiments, subjects are separately trained on different stimulus arrangements, and then are tested on their ability to integrate the temporal relationships between events to form expectations about stimulus arrangements that they have not directly experienced. One example comes from when subjects were initially trained using a backward conditioning arrangement in which a US occurred 5 s before a CS (denoted S1) [61]. The animals then learned about a stimulus arrangement in which S1 was preceded by another CS (S2) such that S2 coterminated with the hypothetical onset of the US, which was omitted. Subjects demonstrated a signifciant conditioned response to S2 in a fnial test phase, even though they had never been reinforced following presentation of S2, suggesting that they had formed a temporal representation of the event structure.

## Hopper -Switch Task
> The rapid nature of this learning is further apparent in experiments that used a hopper-switch task [52–54] in which reward is probabilistically assigned on each trial to one of two hoppers. If reward is assigned to the ‘short’ hopper, the mouse receives a food pellet by poking the hopper after 3 s have elapsed. If reward is assigned to the ‘long’ hopper, the mouse receives a pellet by poking the hopper after 9 s have elapsed. The optimal policy depends on the probability distribution over hoppers. Occasionally, this distribution was changed, and the authors estimated that mice took approximately 10 trials to detect the change, after which there was an abrupt shift in their behavior. Thus, temporal information appears to be used to update parameters in an internal model to achieve change detection, rather than the gradual adjustment of behavior anticipated by standard model-free algorithms. 
> 
> Even more decisive evidence for the flexibility of timing has been provided using a variant of the hopper-switch task in which mice are frist trained on each hopper separately (i.e., no switching) and then in the test phase given a choice between hoppers [55]. Despite never having been trained on the two-hopper task, mice almost immediately and stably adopted the optimal policy in the test phase, going frist to the ‘short’ hopper and then, if not rewarded, to the ‘long’ hopper. Moreover, mice calibrated their switch latency to the probability of reward, staying longer at the ‘short’ hopper when its reward frequency was higher during the training phase.

- Sounds a lot like the “nose-poke” task
- Isn’t this just bisection yeah?

## Pattern training


## massed training
stimuli repeated immediately (massed-trained), without delay

## Spaced training
Seems more memory oriented.

We found that learning was slower for stimuli repeated after a long delay (spaced-trained) compared to those repeated immediately (massed-trained), likely reflecting the remaining contribution of feedback learning mechanisms when working memory is not available.

Also birdsongs
- But this is less an animal model of interval timing
