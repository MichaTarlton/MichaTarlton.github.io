Physical Symbol System Hypothesis (PSSH)
> A physical symbol system has the 
necessary and sufficient means for 
intelligent action
(Newell & Simon, 1976)


– a system, embodied physically, that is engaged in 
the manipulation of symbols
– an entity is potentially intelligent iff. it instantiates a 
physical symbol system
– symbols must designate
– symbols must be atomic
– symbols may be combined to form expressions
