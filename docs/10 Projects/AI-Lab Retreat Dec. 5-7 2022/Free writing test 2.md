# Free writing assignment
The idea is to just write a short story

One of strange ideas perhaps

I donâ€™t what narrative to tell though perhaps I, per usual, have an outline 

What is e-prop, I believe it is just an applied three-factor Hebbian model

What was the thing you wanted tow rite about or thought may be important

***Criticality theory in Spiking Neural Networks***

Criticality Theory, is an end goal to our project. A set of new laws describing the balance of a self-propagating, active, dynamical system.
This balance, between run-away randomeness and sedentary fixed-pointed-ness, must have some universal law of some sort.
Some control parameter(s) that can be attuned to any system. As it is, this balance is of bespoke design to the individual systems.

Not really a story lmao, but fuck this

# Story Prompt
Night dawned upon the boat much like the sunrise dusked upon it earlier. Walked about was the harpooner who had not thought for the git with the beard. She sat upon the dock, staring stoically with the rest of the seawives, seeing upon the men who would set out to some whisked plateau of foam and weed and plying dark glass. The unknown it was, despite it being so small, and ever smaller did it grow still as the seawives widowed and the deckhands withered and gristled into their tanning skins. one day there would be no floats at all, no driftpiece to rock into flotsam or survive to be jetsam. All that would be is a new glassy front, a new type of float, one which would drift between large stretches of further nothingness.


More poetic I guess.
